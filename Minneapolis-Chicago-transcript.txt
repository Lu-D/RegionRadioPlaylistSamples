Bundled in parkas and ski masks, mittens and scarves, the people of Hubert Humphrey's adopted state paid him their final tributes last week. Not even subzero cold could keep them away as they waited patiently on the steps of Minnesota's capitol rotunda in St. Paul for a view of Humphrey's flag-draped casket inside. Among the mourners: a newsboy with his paper bag still slung over his shoulder and a visitor, California's Governor Jerry Brown.

Portrait of French Countess Heads for Minneapolis

The Minneapolis Institute of Arts (MIA) has acquired a rare, and even more rarely seen, oil painting from the mid-18th century. The rococo portrait of Comtesse d'Egmont Pignatelli was completed in 1763 by Swedish-born painter Alexander Roslin. It is now on view at the institute's recently renovated galleries.
Known for her beauty and intelligence, the countess was a key figure in the court of King Louis XV.
Roslin, who settled in Paris in 1752, quickly established himself as a fashionable and technically skilled portraitist in the king's court.
Curator Patrick Noon talks about the significance of the acquisition, considered one of the masterpieces of 18th-century French portraiture. The painting has been on public view only four times in the last 250 years; the MIA acquired the painting from New York's Wildenstein & Co. Noon says the painting has already been requested for several exhibitions, including a major Roslin retrospective in Stockholm.

Minneapolis Sculpture Garden In college I studied literaturewhich is good preparation for life, but not for work. After graduation I became Tom Sawyer; my job was to paint my parents fence in Ohio. While painting, I came up with my next plan: I wanted to be a lifeguard at Walden Pond, near Concord, Massachusetts. To my chagrin as a Thoreauvian, this job was not available. But in the meantime I discovered one that was: teaching inner-city third graders in Minneapolis. I took the job. Turns out I was more a playmate than a teacherthe kids loved me, and I them, but between our affections, few lessons were learned. So what? We had fun. My favorite project was to walk my studentsNeandra, Channelle, Terese (they were the Supremes of the eight-year-old set), Winston, and DAngelo, among themto the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden at the Walker Art Center. This dreamy landscape incorporates acres of gardens and dozens of jaw-dropping sculptures by such artists as Isamu Noguchi, Henry Moore, George Segal, Frank Gehry, and more. At the gardens heart is the ludicrous Spoonbridge and Cherrya 50-foot-long dessert spoon scooping a 15-foot-high water-squirting cherry over a small lily pondby Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen. If you ever want to render kids speechless, bring them here. To get to the garden, my students and I crossed the artful Irene Hixon Whitney Bridge (itself a sculpture by Siah Armajani), which spans 16 lanes of traffic. Along the bridges upper beams, a poem by John Ashberry reads And now I cannot remember how I would have had it. It is not a conduit (confluence?) but a place. The place of movement and an order... As a traveler, I think this means that the places we love arent so much specific locations as they are vessels of memory and meaning, reflections of ourselves at a specific time in life. So to say that my place of a lifetime is the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden isnt entirely accurate because for me the garden wasnt so much a place as it was an escape from having to be in a specific place. And now that the garden holds my memories, I cant tell whether its the garden I love or the memories of it that I love. Or maybe Im too much the literature major here. Maybe its enough to say that I will return to the garden not just to see the sculptures again, but to see myself anew. George W. Stone George W. Stone is a Traveler assistant editor.

The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley is apologizing for turning away two people eligible for COVID-19 vaccinations on Saturday because they could not prove they live in the United States.
On Feb. 21, it posted a statement on Twitter. UT Health Rio Valley, the clinical practice of the university, stated it "apologizes to those patients who were affected" and "did not follow the most current State of Texas guidelines."
Proof of residency and citizenship are not required to get the vaccine, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services — as stated in guidance on the agency's website. UT-RGV spokesperson Patrick Gonzalez confirmed the university did not follow state protocol.
Abraham Diaz, who lives in San Juan, says his father was one of the people turned away. He tweeted about the experience on Feb. 20.
Diaz said his dad called him upset and embarrassed after waiting in line for four hours at the UT-RGV vaccine clinic, only to be wrongly told by a person working there he was not eligible for the shot.
"[Dad] said that [the health worker] told him in front of everybody, 'you don't have a social, so we can't help you at all. And it's only for U.S. citizens,' " said Diaz.
The Rio Grande Valley is located near the U.S.-Mexico border and is a majority Hispanic region with a large number of undocumented and mixed-status families.
The university said it is working to reschedule individuals wrongly turned away.

New Stamp Features Art by Maryland Artist Robert Bealle
The U.S. Doors open at 9:00 a.m., and the ceremony begins at 10:00 a.m. Last fall, a panel of five judges chose Bealle’s art to grace the new Duck Stamp from among 224 paintings at the Federal Duck Stamp Art Contest, held at the Patuxent Research Refuge in Laurel, Maryland.Bealle, a lifelong resident of southern Maryland, initially gained recognition as a wildlife artist after placing second in the 1983 Federal Duck Stamp Contest. Before winning the Federal Duck Stamp Contest in 2009, he also won three Maryland Duck Stamp Contests (1994, 2003 and 2008).Rui Huang, an 18-year-old from Columbus, Ohio, created the new Junior Duck Stamp, featuring a hooded merganser. Huang’s art was chosen from among 51 Best-of Show winners from every state and the District of Columbia at the National Junior Duck Stamp, held last April at the Minnesota Science Museum in St. Paul.Bealle and Huang will both be on hand at the June 25 ceremony. Other participants are U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Assistant Director for Migratory Birds Paul Schmidt; Martin MacDonald, director of conservation for Bass Pro Shops; and Mike Matousek of the U.S. Postal Service. After a formal ceremony and the sale of the first stamps, the artists and other event participants will be available for autographs, interviews and photo opportunities.The Bass Pro Shops retail store in Rancho Cucamonga, California, is also planning a special event on June 25 to celebrate the First Day of Sale for the Federal Duck Stamp. Ninety-eight percent of the proceeds from the $15 Duck Stamp go to the Migratory Bird Conservation Fund, which supports wetlands acquisition for the National Wildlife Refuge System.Since 1934, Federal Duck Stamp sales have raised more than $750 million to acquire and protect more than 5.3 million acres of wetlands, including habitat on hundreds of the 552 National Wildlife Refuges spread across all 50 states and U.S. territories. Refuges offer unparalleled outdoor recreational opportunities, including hunting, fishing, bird watching and photography.The 2010 Federal Duck Stamp Contest will be held October 15-16 at the David Brower Center in Berkeley, California.The Federal Junior Duck Stamp Conservation and Design Program is a dynamic arts curriculum that teaches wetlands and waterfowl conservation to students in kindergarten through high school. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service sells the Junior Duck Stamp for $5 to stamp collectors, conservationists and the general public. All of the proceeds from Junior Duck Stamp sales are used to support environmental education efforts and awards for contest winners.

Ohio Youth Wins the Federal Junior Duck Stamp Competition
The U.S. The design for the new stamp, painted by 18-year old Rui Huang of Columbus, Ohio, was chosen by a panel of judges at the National Junior Duck Stamp Design Contest held at the Science Museum of Minnesota in St. Paul.
The prisma-color entry, which previously won the Ohio State Junior Duck Stamp Contest, was judged the winner among Best-of-Show entries from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Fish and Wildlife Service sells for $5 to stamp collectors, conservationists, and the general public will be released on June 25, 2010. Proceeds from Junior Duck Stamp sales support environmental and conservation education efforts, and awards for contest winners.
“I’m excited to celebrate our winning artist and all of the young people who participate in the Junior Duck Stamp Conservation and Design Program each year,” said Rowan Gould, acting director of the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service. “As we mark the 40th anniversary of Earth Day this week, we look to our younger generation as stewards of conservation and the keepers of our Earth for the generations that follow them.”
Ciara Davis, age 18, of Lebanon, Pennsylvania, took second place with an acrylic painting depicting a pair of hooded mergansers.
Third place went to Miri Kim, age 15, of Charlestown, Rhode Island for her rendition of a red-breasted merganser.
The 2010 Federal Junior Duck Stamp Conservation Message Contest winner was Patrick Hull from Arizona, with his entry: “Wildlife speaks only the truth about our planet’s future, but our greatest challenge is learning to listen.”
The National Junior Duck Stamp Design Contest is the culmination of a year-long Junior Duck Stamp conservation curriculum used by educators across the nation. This year, more than 26,000 Junior Duck Stamp design entries were entered to be judged during
State competitions held from February until mid-April. The judges are people active in the local wildlife art or conservation community.
The top three entries from among the state Best-of-Show winners were chosen today by a panel of five judges. The Junior Duck Stamp Contest winner receives a free trip in June to the First Day of Sale Ceremony for the Federal Duck Stamp, along with their parent. The first-place winner receives a $5,000 award. The second place winner receives $3,000, the third-place winner receives $2,000, and the Conservation Message winner receives $500.
The alternate judge was Jud Dayton, a patron of the arts and lifelong birder.
It is free and open to the public. Both the Federal and Junior Duck Stamp artists will be available to sign stamps and covers at this event, and the U.S. Postal Service will have a special cancellation on-hand for collectors.


Up next is a story about Walmart Garden Center. Battle Creek Lake will be coming up in 3.72 miles, and can be found 0.32 miles from the route to the south or right. 'Walmart Offering In-Store Kiosks for Tax Preparationwas written by Martha C. White and was published on January 20, 2012 by Business. Hope you enjoy! 

Jin Lee / Bloomberg via Getty Images Walmart is bringing back its holiday layaway program a month early.
Walmart has been steadily growing the scope of its financial services, offering unbanked Americans a place to do things like cash checks and pay bills cheaply — located in stores where customers will hopefully turn around and spend some of those dollars. This year, the retailer is making a big push into tax preparation with more than 3,000 Jackson Hewitt or H&R Block kiosks in stores around the country offering free tax prep for filers who use the 1040EZ form. It’s also advertising $3 and $6 flat fees to cash refund checks for customers without a checking account. Walmart says the average tax refund is a little over $2,900, so it’s smart from a business perspective to get these refund recipients into Walmart stores. But is it a good deal for consumers?
According to Walmart’s website, customers can get a free 1040EZ filing at H&R Block kiosks through the end of February, or through the end of tax season at Jackson Hewitt. This sounds like a deal, but the 1040EZ isn’t for everyone, including people who claim dependents or those who itemize deductions. The fine print also warns that people may still have to pay for state or local tax preparation, or for preparation of taxes using forms other than the 1040EZ.
Chi Chi Wu, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center, says some of the tax offerings could be a good alternative to places like check-cashing storefronts for unbanked consumers. But Wu also warns consumers to beware of a couple potential pitfalls.
(MORE: Would You Bank at Walmart?)
First of all, Jackson Hewitt still offers refund anticipation loans (H&R Block has already discontinued offering these high-cost products in advance of an FDIC crackdown that takes effect next year). These pricey products let people get their refund on the spot, for which they’ll pay about a little over $60 for a refund of $1,500 or less, according to the NCLC. But since the wait time to get a refund deposited into an account electronically is only a week or two, that $60 adds up to an annualized APR of 149%.
Refund anticipation checks, which both Walmart tax partners are offering this year, work a little differently. Customers still have to wait one to two weeks to get their refund direct-deposited, but it lets them put off paying for their tax prep services until their money arrives. H&R Block is offering free refund anticipation checks through Feb. 4 for customers who get their refunds deposited onto H&R Block’s own branded prepaid debit card, the Emerald Prepaid MasterCard. (This is for all H&R Block customers, not just the ones using the company’s Walmart kiosks.)
(MORE: The IRS Might Owe You $1,547)
Wu says that while this free offer is a good deal, consumers should think twice about paying for a refund anticipation check. While the cost isn’t high — around $30 — that’s a lot of money to do nothing besides defer a tax prep payment of maybe a couple hundred bucks for just a week or two.

The skeptics were right.
Three students studying animation and digital design at Montreal's Centre NAD, the school says, made a video that's gone viral today because it looks (sort of) like an eagle snatched a baby off the ground and started to fly away with the little kid.
But Centre NAD "reassures Montrealers" that there's "no danger of being snatched by a royal eagle." The video was a digitized class project, not a real snatching.
It IDs the clever students as Normand Archambault, Loïc Mireault and Félix Marquis-Poulin.

Probably not: According to the school, its students have fooled some folks before, with a "Penguin escaped zoo in Montreal!!!" video.

'USFWS: Mussels of the St. Croix Riverwas written by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Enough introduction, here's the story! 

The mission of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Endangered Species program is conserving and restoring threatened and endangered species and their ecosystems.
Mussels of the St. Croix River
The St. Croix River watershed is the premier mussel watershed of the Upper Mississippi River, and one of the premier mussel watersheds of the world.
Forty-one mussel species live in the St. Croix River ("Dan Hornbach's Lab" Macalester College, 04 Feb. 2013). Of these, Wisconsin and Minnesota have listed 15 and 20 as state-endangered or state-threatened species, respectively. Five species of mussels that occur in the St. Croix River are also listed as endangered under the Federal Endangered Species Act: Higgins eye, sheepnose, snuffbox, spectaclecase and winged mapleleaf.
North America is the world's great mussel continent; the richest species aggregations found in any watersheds worldwide are found in North America. North America's best mussel watersheds have species numbers in the upper 30s. Thus, with its 41 species, the St. Croix is among the world's greatest mussel watersheds.
The uncommon richness of mussel species in the St. Croix parallels the uncommon richness of the flora and fauna of the watershed as a whole. The watershed has many uncommon Midwestern species, including some species that were once endangered or threatened and have now recovered – including gray wolves, bald eagles, and peregrine falcons – and some that are still endangered, such as the Karner blue butterfly. One expert characterized the St. Croix as a sanctuary containing the best-preserved (least human-impacted) remnant of pre-settlement natural communities in the Upper Mississippi drainage, and the very best preserved pre-settlement aquatic community in the Upper Mississippi drainage.
The biological diversity of the St. Croix River watershed may be due in large part to the relative lack of intensive agricultural. In contrast, the Minnesota River historically supported a mussel fauna very similar to the St. Croix River, but its watershed supports widespread and intensive agriculture that has greatly modified runoff patterns and river habitats. It now supports only low densities of a few mussel species.
In a sense, the St. Croix watershed is an island of near-pre-settlement conditions surrounded by the more developed and altered North America of the Twentieth Century. Local popular sentiment, increasing involvement and commitment by state and Federal conservation and other agencies, and the Federal Wild and Scenic River designation of the Namekagon-St. Croix reflect the watershed's value and offer practical vehicles for protecting the watershed from what may be disastrous decimation of its mussel fauna should zebra mussels successfully invade.

Now it's time for a story about Hudson Soccer Complex. Hudson Soccer Complex will be coming up in 3.76 miles, and can be found 0.86 miles from the route to the north or left. 'From Wisconsin to the West Sideby Scientific American. Hope you like it! 

It's a sweltering afternoon in August 2002. The mottled reddish brown eaglets, who wont acquire the characteristic white head and tail feathers of mature bald eagles until they are four to five years old, pant as they gaze out from their wooden platform, high up in the trees on a steep hill overlooking a salt marsh estuary in upper Manhattan. The eaglets are the first living in the borough in more than three centuries and, many hope, they will choose to stay.
A television monitor in the Inwood Hill Nature Center offers a close-up view of the eaglets' enclosure, and a ranger uses a toggle to zoom in and follow their movements. The image can also be accessed live on the parks Web site. When the eagles first arrived and were too young to fly, they were kept in the two large cages on the platform. Now the doors are open, and theyre allowed to come and go as they test their wings. No one can predict how long they might remain in the area--it could be weeks or months.
One eagle perches on the heap of branches and slimy fish heads in its cage, nibbling the scaly tail of a raw salmon. The eagles are fed 16 pounds of fresh fish daily, but its delivered through a tube at the back of their enclosure so that they do not become accustomed to their human caretakers. Another eaglet takes a bath, splashing in the blue plastic water dish in its cage. A third glides over the nature center and marsh, and then lands on top of the enclosure.
The eaglets were collected from nests in northern Wisconsin by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources when they were approximately six weeks old. Since adults often cant raise more than one bird to maturity, the eaglets are taken from nests with multiple birds--where they may not have otherwise survived--and then released in other states. The method the Parks Department is using to reintroduce the eagles, called "hacking," was adapted from falconry. Birds are either hatched in captivity or collected from nests and then transferred to man-made towers.
Already, the young birds' adventurousness has had their human caretakers holding their breath. The youngest, a male, got stuck in the mud while attempting to fish in the marsh during low tide, and had to be rescued by the rangers. Another rescue took place when an eagle landed on a soccer field crowded with kids and dogs.
The Inwood eagles are now venturing out farther each day, routinely taking flights of 10 to 20 miles into the Bronx and up the Hudson, though they still return to the tree house for free meals. They wear tiny backpack radio transmitters, so the rangers can track their whereabouts. One was recently spotted more than 35 miles away, near Buchanan, New York, flying with another eagle. As Alexander Brash, the chief of New York City's Urban Park Rangers, says, "It looks like it may have already found a friend." --Jennifer Usher

Green Bay National Wildlife Refuge consists of Hog Island (2 acres), Plum Island (325 acres), Pilot Island (3.7 acres), St. Martin Island (1,260 acres, not entire island), and Rocky Island (10 acres). The islands are located in Lake Michigan, near Washington Island, off the tip of Wisconsin’s Door Peninsula.
In 1912, Hog Island was set aside as a preserve and breeding ground for native birds. Green Bay National Wildlife Refuge became the 28th refuge in the U.S. and second in the Great Lakes region. Hog Island and nearby Gravel Island National Wildlife Refuge (Gravel and Spider Islands) make up the Wisconsin Islands Wilderness Area.
Plum and Pilot Islands were transferred from the U.S. Coast Guard to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 2007. The islands were acquired to protect additional migratory bird and endangered species habitat in the Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem. All public use is prohibited on Hog and Pilot Islands due to ground nesting by migratory birds and the limited and treacherous access.
Green Bay National Wildlife Refuge is managed as part of a complex that also includes Horicon National Wildlife Refuge, 22,000 acres near Mayville, WI; Fox River National Wildlife Refuge, 1,054 acres in Montello, WI; Gravel Island National Wildlife Refuge, 27 acres, located in Lake Michigan near Washington Island, WI; and Leopold Wetland Management District, 57 waterfowl production areas, totaling 13,000 acres, located in 17 counties throughout Wisconsin.

District: Medford-Park Falls, Park Falls Unit
Description: Located adjacent to the Twin Lakes campground, this site has a 20 yard bog boardwalk leading to the edge of Twin Lake. The wetlands of this site feature an open bog/muskeg which is floristically more diverse than others in the vicinity. A bog lake and several ponds add to the considerable variety of this peatland habitat. The bog supports good populations of insectivorous plants including pitcher plants (Sarracenia purpurea), sundews (Drosera) and bladderworts (Utricularia). Grass-pink (Calopogon tuberosus) and pink lady-slipper (Cypripedium acaule) are some of the orchid species found here. The uplands are forested with young, mixed pine. Ground layer species includes a number of plant species associated with xeric (dry) plant communities, such as trailing arbutus (Epigaea repens) and asters.
Safety First: Take a topographic map and compass (USGS Pike Lake quad maps are available at Forest Service offices).Waterproof boots are recommended to explore the wetlands. Weather in the spring and summer can be unpredictable - dress appropriately. Come prepared to deal with insects.
Directions: From Park Falls, travel east on State Highway 182 to Forest Road 144. Turn right (south) and travel 5 miles to Forest Road 142. Turn left (east) for 2 miles to the campground entrance. From Twin Lakes campground go past the last campsite to an unmarked trail to your right. Follow this trail a short distance to the bog boardwalk, which will take you the lake. To access the pine forest, use the trail at the end of the campground loop (1177).

National Wildlife Refuges
Where Wildlife Comes First
Created in 1903 by President Theodore Roosevelt, today's National Wildlife Refuge System protects habitats and wildlife across the country, from the Alaskan tundra to subtropical wetlands. Managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Refuge System's 560-plus refuges cover more than 150 million acres and protect nearly 1,400 species of birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, and fish.
While national wildlife refuges were created to protect wildlife, they are for people too. Refuges are ideal places for people of all ages to explore and connect with the natural world. We invite you to learn more about and visit the national wildlife refuges and wetland management districts in Colorado, Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming.

About Us About the Migratory Bird Program
The Migratory Bird Program works with partners to protect, restore and conserve bird populations and their habitats for the benefit of future generations by:
ensuring long-term ecological sustainability of all migratory bird populations,
increasing socioeconomic benefits derived from birds,
improving hunting and bird watching and other outdoor bird-related experiences, and
increasing awareness of the value of migratory birds and their habitats for their aesthetic, ecological, recreational and economic significance.
Among our major roles in bird management and habitat conservation, we conduct surveys; coordinate with public-private bird conservation partnerships; provide matching grants for partner-based conservation efforts; administer conservation laws and develop policies and regulations; and issue permits that allow individuals and organizations to participate in migratory bird conservation in a variety of ways.
We also help educate and engage our nation's youth in wildlife conservation topics and provide resources for parents and educators who want to help their students explore and appreciate our natural world and our feathered friends.
There are many ways that you can be involved in bird conservation! Buy a Federal Duck Stamp or Junior Duck Stamp, participate in a community citizen science project, mentor a child interested in learning to hunt, or simply grab your binoculars and step outside to watch birds in your backyard or at a park or national wildlife refuge.

Perdido Basin
The Perdido Bay Focus Area encompasses approximately 772,486 acres in eastern Baldwin County, and a small portion of western Escambia County, Alabama and western Santa Rosa County, Florida. The Perdido River is the major waterway in this focus area, emptying into the Perdido Bay. Other waterbodies contained within this focus area include Wolf Bay, a portion of the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway, and numerous smaller bays, bayous, and coves. Species that may benefit from habitat restoration in this area are Perdido Key beach mice, manatees, migratory birds (shorebirds, wading birds, waterfowl, neotropical migratory songbirds, etc.) and anadromous fish (Gulf sturgeon, Alabama shad, and striped bass).

Graham Creek Park Enhancement
Graham Creek Park in Baldwin County, Alabama consists of 484 acres of forested bottomland wetlands, pine savannah, longleaf pine forest, open fields, and Graham Creek and other tributaries. The park was opened to the public in 2009. Amenities include a canoe launch, pavilion, and several miles of trails. Recreational opportunities include hiking, bird watching, botanizing, paddling, biking, and picnicking.
An inventory documented hundreds of different species occurring in the Park, including several rare and uncommon species. The Park, though, has a problem with invasive (exotic) species (nine documented, to date).
The purpose of this Cooperative Agreement was to assist the City of Foley with the necessary funding for invasive species removal and appropriate prescribed burning at Graham Creek Park.

Baldwin Meadow
Forest: Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit
Description: The Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit is located in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Both Forest Service land and Lake Tahoe straddle California-Nevada state line. The lake's elevation averages 6,225 feet, and surrounding peaks reach heights of up to 10,880 feet. Relaxation and recreation abound in the Lake Tahoe Basin. Please come and enjoy one of your national treasures.
Baldwin Meadow is located near the shore of Lake Tahoe and offers spectacular views of Mount Tallac in the background. After a short walk to Baldwin Meadows, a side trip can be taken to Baldwin Beach.
Viewing Information: The meadow is easy to access from Baldwin Beach. In mid to late July, the brilliant pink flowering stems of little elephants head (Pedicularis attollens) dominate the meadow. In addition to little elephants head, purple lupine flowers (Lupinus sp. ), rose-pink bog mallow flowers (Sidalcea oregana), yellow graceful cinquefoil flowers (Potentilla gracilis), yellow monkey flowers (Mimulus primuloides), white margined hairy paintbrush flowers (Castilleja pilosa), white yarrow flowers (Achillea millefolium), yellow native Klamath weed flowers (Hypericum formosum), and yellow flowered Arnica (Arnica sp.) all add to the spectacular wild flower display.
Safety First: Summer traffic is often very busy so stay aware while driving and walking in vehicle areas. This is a high elevation area (6,230 feet), so beware of altitude sickness and increased solar radiation. This area currently has active horse grazing on it during a portion of the summer. Do not go into fenced areas while horses are present.
Directions: From South Lake Tahoe, take Highway 89 north to Baldwin Beach. Follow Baldwin Beach road; take a left at the fork in the road and park in the western parking lot by the beach. Walk away from the beach following the east side of an old barb wire fence to the meadow.

Wetlands
Horicon National Wildlife Refuge. Credit: USFWS.
Wetlands provide a multitude of ecological, economic and social benefits. They provide habitat for fish, wildlife and plants - many of which have a commercial or recreational value - recharge groundwater, reduce flooding, provide clean drinking water, offer food and fiber, and support cultural and recreational activities. Unfortunately, over half of America’s wetlands have been lost since 1780, and wetland losses continue today. This highlights the urgent need for geospatial information on wetland extent, type, and change.
The National Wetlands Inventory
The US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is the principal US Federal agency tasked with providing information to the public on the status and trends of our Nation's wetlands. The US FWS National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) is a publicly available resource that provides detailed information on the abundance, characteristics, and distribution of US wetlands. NWI data are used by natural resource managers, within the US FWS and throughout the Nation, to promote the understanding, conservation and restoration of wetlands.

Elk had been exterminated from the Wichita Mountains by 1875. Since their reintroduction, the herd has thrived—today numbering approximately 800 animals.
Each year in September, the rut—or reproduction period— begins, lasting 4-6 weeks. Bulls compete for groups of cows (harems) to breed with, and the sound of their bugling (call) can be heard throughout the range. Calves are born in June, and the herds will split into smaller groups to graze throughout the summer.

It’s almost impossible to overhype Moab. Its red-rock landscape is truly like nowhere else on Earth, and the best way to appreciate it is by riding it. Famed trails like Porcupine Rim, Slickrock, and the Whole Enchilada steal the spotlight, but it’s the area’s newer and lesser known trails that make a trip to Moab a mandatory pilgrimage for any mountain biker.
The new intermediate-friendly trail systems north of town—North Klondike, Sovereign, Klonzo, and the Brands—all connect. Navajo Rocks, off the road to Canyonlands, offers 18 miles of slickrock, flow, and scenic views and Magnificent 7 (or Mag 7) links upper and lower Gemini Bridges Road in one ledgy, memorable traverse.
With sunbaked desert riding, high-alpine singletrack in the nearby La Sal Mountains, and everything in between, it’s possible to ride in Moab year-round, but temperatures are most comfortable in spring and fall (fall being your best chance to ride the Whole Enchilada).
Beyond the riding, Moab is the gateway to Arches and Canyonlands National Parks, a spectacular stretch of the Colorado River, and world-famous climbing at Indian Creek in Bears Ears National Monument.

Location: Cross Creeks National Wildlife Refuge in Stewart County, TN, Lake Barkley/Cumberland River
Access: There are two access points for this bay.1) Double boat ramp off highway 233 just east of Carlisle; 2) small concrete ramp 9 miles past the refuge office/visitor center along gravel road that follows the Cumberland River.
Time Allotment: 2.5 hour +
Restrictions: This refuge is closed seasonally from Nov. 15th to Mar. 15th
Hazards: Most of the time this bay is fairly wind protected, but the wind can be a factor on the larger fingers of the bay.
Scenic Area: Elk Reservoir is a favorite for kayaking and canoeing in this area due the ease of access, its scenic beauty, and the large protected area with little boat traffic. This bay is fairly protected from the wind and motorized boats are restricted to idle speed/no wake.
Mostly clear shallow water filled with a variety of fish and wildlife. The many fingers of the bay make exploration fun and exciting.
Bring snacks, water, bug repellent, and binoculars
Wildlife Viewing: Great
This area is somewhat remote, therefore a wide variety of wildlife frequents the area throughout the year. Osprey and bald eagles can be seen frequently fishing in areas throughout the bay. An osprey platform is in the back of the middle finger of the bay and is occupied in the summer months. A wide variety of songbirds are common sites along the forest edge. Herons and other wading birds are frequently viewed along with cormorants. White-tailed deer are common along the shoreline.
Waterfowl begin arriving on their migration route just before we open or close for sanctuary (seasonally closed from Nov. 15th – Mar. 15th).

How To Find A Food Desert Near You
toggle caption USDA
Want to know where you can't buy fresh, healthful food? The USDA has the map for you.
The feds' new Food Access Research Atlas lets you find out just where it's difficult to buy broccoli or bananas in counties across the U.S. Forget walking to the store in St. Louis, Minn., where most people live more than a mile from a grocery store. Ditto for Hyde, N.C., and Pushmataha, Okla.
The atlas, which is a big upgrade from the USDA's 2-year-old Food Desert Locator, is intended as a tool for state policymakers, local planners and nonprofit groups concerned about food access.
"People can get a more detailed picture of exactly what challenges they encounter in getting to the grocery store," says Paula Dutko, an economist for the USDA Economic Research Service who helped craft the atlas.
Detailed, indeed. A few clicks and you're deep into individual neighborhoods, showing what percentage of people aren't within walking distance of a supermarket.
Thus I learned that an area just north of NPR's new headquarters on North Capitol Street Northeast "has a relatively high number of households (656 of 1,802 total households (36%)) without vehicles that are more than one-half mile from a supermarket."
Enlarge this image toggle caption USDA USDA
Dutko and her crew added data on whether households have vehicles, because that can make a huge difference in grocery shopping. And they added more choices for distance from a store, including 20 miles for rural areas, instead of just 10.
Access by bus or train isn't on the map, Dutko says, because there are no national data. "It would be so great if we could look at public transportation availability throughout the United States," she told The Salt.
Food deserts have been a hot target of healthy-eating efforts, including Michelle Obama's Let's Move campaign.
But as programs zero in on improving access, they're finding that bringing in farmers markets and grocery stores doesn't necessarily mean that people start eating better.
So as our colleague Dan Charles has reported, efforts are now also working on lowering costs, consumer education and marketing.

Eastern Region Viewing Area
St. Peters Dome / Morgan Falls
Forest: Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest
District: Great Divide
Description: This area represents a large block of unfragmented forest, which includes exposed cliffs, streams, a 70 foot waterfall and a breathtaking overlook at the top of St. Peter's Dome (known locally as Old Baldy) which has an excellent view of Chequamegon Bay of Lake Superior and the Apostle Islands.
This large site (approx. 5000 acres) of uninterrupted forest is rich in geological and botanical diversity. The site contains several plant communities including northern hardwood, hardwood swamp, sedge meadow and wet- and dry-mesic conifer forests.
St. Peters Dome/Morgan Falls is an excellent site for viewing ferns including the rare Braun's hollyfern (Polystichum braunii) and fragrant woodfern (Dryopteris fragrans), and the beautiful northern maidenhair fern (Adiantum pedatum). There are also large patches of hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) and Canada yew (Taxus canadensis) regeneration, an uncommon occurrence elsewhere. This area is wonderful for viewing of spring wildflowers including large-flowered trillium (Trillium grandiflorum), violets and Dutchman's-breeches (Dicentra cucullaria). Other common plants include trout lily (Erythronium americanum), blue-bead lily (Clintonia borealis) and baneberry (Actaea sp.)
Viewing Information: The trail to Morgan Falls (1.2 miles round trip) was reconstructed in 2002 to make it accessible for people with disabilities. The trail is graveled and the slopes are fairly flat. Morgan Falls is a serene oasis, an almost mystical place. The vegetation is very fragile, some plants rare. Care should be taken to stay on the trail and off the cliffs, rocks, and vegetation in and on the way to the falls.
The trail to St. Peter's Dome (3.6 miles round trip) is fairly rugged with quite a bit of exposed rocks in the trail and steep climb. Signs of past human enterprises can be seen along the way: the old CCC Camp at the trail's onset and remnants of an old stone quarry further up the trail. The trek to the dome's crest is well worth the effort. The panoramic view of the Chequamegon Bay of Lake Superior, and the Apostle Islands, is an unforgettable experience.
Safety First: Appropriate footwear for rough terrain is a must. Clothing appropriate for weather conditions is recommended and a compass/topographic map is a necessity for off trail explorations. Directions: The site is located approximately 15 miles south of Ashland, Wisconsin. Follow County Line Rd. (FR 199) from Cty. Hwy. E to the parking area (fee required). The site is bordered by FR 199 to the west and south and FR 187 to the east.

College Waitlists Often Waste Would-Be Students' Time
Enlarge this image Rob Dobi for NPR Rob Dobi for NPR
"Does being waitlisted count as half an acceptance??"
"Literally got waitlisted everywhere"
"Being waitlisted from your top choice is the worst feeling"
"What should one do when waitlisted at their top choice school? Asking for a friend."
"All these waitlisted got me feelin like Ladybird."
Those are just some of the thoughts that high school seniors have tweeted in the past few weeks. They've opened their mail — or, more likely, an online portal — to finally hear decisions from colleges. But many didn't get one. The number of students placed on college waiting lists has climbed in recent years, leaving students hoping for the best — even when they might not have any reason to hope at all.
"Many students ... think they're very close to getting in, and that there's considerable hope for them to be admitted to the college," says Cristiana Quinn, a private college admissions counselor in Rhode Island.
That's not the case. In the spring of 2017, Dartmouth College, a small ivy league school in New Hampshire, offered 2,021 waitlist spots to applicants. Of the 1,345 who chose to stay on the waitlist, not a single person got in. The University of Michigan offered 11,127 potential freshman a place on their waitlist that spring — 4,124 students accepted spots on the list, and 470 eventually got in.
The odds aren't as slim elsewhere: At the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire, 100 of the 450 students on the waitlist were accepted in 2017. And some schools, like North Carolina A&T State University and the University of Alabama, don't use a waitlist at all. According to 2017 numbers from the National Association of College Admission Counseling, about 40 percent of colleges use waitlists.
The schools that do make applicants wait for a final decision do so to keep their options open, says Quinn, who works with students and families during the college application process.
"They want to have a very large pool to choose from — so that, for instance, if they don't have a student from South Dakota, they can pull one from South Dakota. If they don't have a student who plays the oboe, they can pick an oboe player, and on and on," she says. When schools keep their admission rates low, it impacts school rankings and reputation — plus, intentional or not, the more students who almost get in are now thinking, talking and tweeting about them.
Quinn recently penned an open letter to college admissions officers on a private email list of admissions professionals.
"I beg you to stop the insanity," she wrote. "Stop what you are doing to kids and parents and move to a modicum of reality next year when you create your waiting lists." She says all of her students awaiting spring decisions were wait-listed at at least one school — and many of them were wait-listed at many. That hasn't happened in the past.
"[Students] are not fully exploring the colleges where they have been accepted," she says. Instead, they hold out hope for the colleges where they've been wait-listed. For low-income students, who depend on aid for tuition assistance, holding out for an offer becomes unrealistic because colleges often have little if any financial aid left over by the time they turn to the waiting list.
So what should students do once they've been wait-listed?
Quinn encourages students she works with to write letters of continued interest to colleges — and to apply to other schools with rolling deadlines and openings.
"All is not lost," she tells them.

Wisconsin Gov. Walker Takes Prank Call From Fake 'Koch' Brother
Enlarge this image toggle caption Andy Manis/AP Andy Manis/AP
Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker fell prey to a prank phone call from a New York blogger impersonating David Koch, one of the two wealthy brothers who were big donors to his political campaign and GOP efforts generally.
The 20-minute conversation with the blogger from the Buffalo Beast, whose site is down, is available on the Mother Jones web site. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reports:
The editor of the website is Ian Murphy, who claims on the Beast's website to have made the call. Attempts to reach someone at the website have been unsuccessful.
(Updated at 2:54 pm: The Huffington Post has an interview with Murphy.)
Walker's office confirms it's the governor on the phone call in what has to be, if nothing else, an embarrassment for Walker and his top aides.
While Walker doesn't say anything that appears immediately career-ending, when the fake Koch suggests putting "troublemakers" in the crowd of protesters who've been at the Wisconsin state capitol for eight consecutive days, presumably to discredit them, Walker says: "We thought about that."
But the governor quickly pivoted, saying he and others concluded that real unrest might swing public opinion against him and that it was better to let the protests play out, that the media would eventually lose interest. His critics will likely jump on the fact that he didn't say it would be wrong.
That revelation that he would even discuss injecting agent provocateurs sounded, to me at least, like the most damning part of a recording.
By the way, it appears the recording would be legal if the call originated in New York because both that state and Wisconsin are "one-party consent" states in which only one person on the call, the recording person in this case, need to consent to the recording. The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press has details.
Even saying this, I have to admit to being somewhat torn about this story and having some part of me that responded with revulsion at this prank.
First, I hate pranks of all kinds, but that's just me. I think the intent to make someone look foolish often says more about the prankster than the victim.
Second, secretly recording someone and then trying to verbally entrap them in the conversation into embarrassing or unethical statements just seems morally wrong to me.
Some liberals might say conservatives deserve their comeuppance for the ACORN recordings.
To that I would say quote Martin Luther King Jr. : "The old law of eye for an eye leaves everybody blind."
The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has a story on the prank with a number of quotes from the recording as well as criticism of the governor by his opponents. An excerpt:

Sharp-tailed Grouse Leks
With the coming of warm air and prairie crocuses of spring also comes the annual courtship display of many birds. One of the most unique and easiest to observe is the "dancing" of the sharp-tailed grouse. Each spring, the male sharp-tails return to traditional dancing grounds, or leks, to display their dancing abilities and attract females. Each male has his own little territory on the lek and fights often develop if another invades. After several days or weeks of dancing and courtship, nesting will occur.

Building the original elevator to the mountain’s summit in 1949 took workers 18 months to blast through solid granite, creating a 258-foot shaft reached through a 198-foot-long tunnel. It was completely revamped.
The park has also overhauled the Outcroppings Trail, a companion series of 491 stairs that also allows access to points on the summit. The former Outcroppings Trail was a network of wooden stairs built piece-meal over the first half of the 20th century. Rebuilding them involved four helicopter airlift missions to transport construction materials. Steel columns were carefully lowered between rock outcroppings and large trees onto new concrete footings.
The projects were completed by contractors supported by state park staff and Chimney Rock Management, the private firm that operates visitor facilities within the Chimney Rock section of the 5,700-acre state park. Chimney Rock had been a private tourist destination before it was incorporated into the state park system in 2007. The Morse family started developing the popular attraction in 1902.

The Narrows of the Wisconsin Dells
The Wisconsin Dells
Have you ever heard of a dell? The Wisconsin Dells are dramatic rock formations found along the Wisconsin River. They were shaped by strong currents of water from melting glaciers. About 500 million years ago, this area was a lot different than it looks today. It used to be covered by shallow seas. For about 80 million years the seas flowed back and forth over the land, leaving sand on the sea bottom. Over time, the sand kept building up until it rose above the seas. The huge sand formations that rose out of the water are the tall sandstone cliffs you see today in the Wisconsin Dells. These unique cliffs can be found in only three other areas in the world, Switzerland, Germany and parts of New York. The Wisconsin Dells got their name from the French term "dalles." It means "slab-like rock." Some of the more distinctive rock formations are named for objects they resemble, such as Chimney Rock. During the 1800s, the Dells grew to be a popular tourist attraction in Wisconsin. Visitors still enjoy exploring the area's caves and arches.

Fish Habitat in the Midwest Benefits from More Than $1 Million in Funding to Protect Against Effects of Climate Change
Midwest Regional Director Tom Melius announced today the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will provide $548,571 to support 13 fish habitat projects in eight Midwestern states under the National Fish Habitat Action Plan (NFHAP). An additional $640,923 in partner contributions will go toward restoring and enhancing stream, lake and coastal habitat, improving recreational fishing and helping endangered species, and supporting long-term protection against the effects of climate change.
More than $13.2 million in total federal and partner contributions will be distributed under NFHAP for fish habitat projects across the United States.
The funding is provided for priority projects identified through Fish Habitat Partnerships established under the NFHAP. Eight of those partnerships directly influence states in the Midwest and direct funding and other resources to habitat improvement projects offering the highest long-term conservation returns.
Aquatic ecosystems are especially vulnerable to changes in climate. Healthy habitats help fish and other aquatic life withstand flows and temperatures that are altered due to climate change. The projects will improve stream flow, remove barriers or acquire scientific information needed for long-term protection against the effects of climate change.
“Climate change, fragmentation, invasive species and habitat destruction harm fish habitat in the Midwest,” said Melius. “It is our responsibility to work with our partners to heal the damage and protect our valuable fishery resources against future harm.”
More than 40 percent of U.S. fish populations are currently considered declining, half of the waters in the U.S. are somehow impaired, and fragmented conservation efforts are not reversing these declines. In addition to helping stem these declines, NFHAP projects also enhance fishing opportunities for the public by putting more dollars on the ground for fish conservation.
NFHAP partnerships to receive funding for Midwest projects include:
Driftless Area Restoration Effort (DARE) - Federal funds: $300,000; Partner contribution $368,873
- Richmond Springs Fish Passage Improvement Project to remove four fish passage barriers and reopen 16 miles to fish passage (IA)
- Williams-Barneveld Creek Stream Corridor Improvement Project to enhance 0.6 instream miles and 1.2 miles of riparian habitat and restore 4 wetland acres (WI)
- Brush Creek Habitat Restoration and Stream Bank Stabilization Project to restore 0.4 instream miles, 2 wetland acres and enhance 0.8 miles of riparian habitat (IA)
- Maquoketa River Iowa Fish Habitat Improvement Project to enhance 4.4 instream miles and 0.6 miles of riparian habitat (IA)

'‘Saving the World’ Inspires More Female Founderswas written by Matthew Hutson, About The Author S, and Recent Articles Matthew Hutson by Scientific American. Please enjoy this Region Radio story! 

The project targeted potential applicants to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Inclusive Innovation Challenge (IIC), a worldwide competition that awards money and other support to small tech companies with strong growth potential. The researchers invited 13,000 founders to register. Some of these e-mailed invitations emphasized cash, with the subject line beginning “More Than $1.6 Million in Prize Money...” Others focused on social impact, with the line “Create Greater Shared Prosperity...”; still others used neutral phrasing. The researchers counted how many times people clicked on links in the e-mail and subsequently on IIC page links.
Men clicked about 55 percent more times total when presented with a money message than a social one, whereas women clicked about 46 percent more times with the socially motivated wording—an unexpectedly big effect, says study co-author Jorge Guzman, a Columbia Business School researcher. Neutral messages performed similarly to money messages. The researchers also noticed a location-based pattern: in countries and U.S. states where residents had previously been found more likely to say they would make charitable donations, the respondents proved more motivated by the social message than the one emphasizing money.
In an 800-person subset of the first group, gender and location were similarly associated with patterns in who ultimately applied for the IIC competition. “You see that by this simple messaging, you can increase people's submitting,” says University of Massachusetts Amherst economist Ina Ganguli, who was not involved in the study. “I think that's really impressive.”
Guzman says targeted messaging is important, whether recruiting entrepreneurs for competitions or teaching students at business school; although the study examined motivations among founders of existing companies, Guzman says would-be entrepreneurs would likely follow similar patterns. Future research, he adds, might look at combining directives: “Get rich and save the world!”

Next up, a story about Saint Stephens Cemetery. Saint Stephens Cemetery will be coming up in 93.56 miles, and can be found 1.79 miles from the route to the north or left. 'Seagrass Forests Counteract Ocean Acidificationwas written by Chelsea Harvey E E News, About The Author S, Recent Articles Chelsea Harvey, and Recent Articles E E News by Scientific American. Enough introduction, here's the story! 

Vast underwater meadows of gently waving sea grass stand sentinel for hundreds of miles up and down the West Coast.
These blue-green fields perform a variety of important services: They protect the shoreline from erosion, clear pollutants from the water and provide habitat for all kinds of marine animals.
New research suggests sea grass meadows may also mitigate a serious consequence of greenhouse gas emissions: the steady acidification of ocean waters.
The study published last week in the journal Global Change Biology finds that sea grass forests can raise pH levels in coastal waters. As they perform photosynthesis, they remove carbon dioxide from the water, counteracting the acidifying effect of the gas.
“I think we are all very excited about it,” said lead study author Aurora Ricart, a scientist at the Bigelow Laboratory for Marine Sciences in Maine. “Because it can really work.”
Ocean acidification is a side effect of rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. Some of this CO 2 dissolves out of the air and into the sea, spurring a chemical reaction that lowers the water’s pH. Scientists sometimes refer to it as global warming’s “evil twin”—an invisible companion to climate change.
Ocean acidification can have harmful effects on marine organisms like shellfish and coral by preventing them from properly forming the hard shells they need to survive. It’s a threat both to natural ecosystems and to shellfish fisheries in the U.S. and elsewhere around the world.
The study presents a natural way to address the problem.
Researchers analyzed six years of data from sea grass meadows spanning more than 600 miles off the California coastline. It focused on the common eelgrass, one of the most widespread sea grass species on the West Coast. The authors claim it’s the largest, most comprehensive study of its kind.
The study finds that sea grass ecosystems can raise pH levels by more than 0.1 unit, equivalent to about a 30% decrease in acidity.
The effect isn’t constant. It comes in waves and is influenced by temperature, daylight, ocean currents and other factors that affect water chemistry and seagrass photosynthesis rates. But the tempering influence on acidification can be lasting, sometimes persisting for up to three weeks at a time.
The study found that pH was higher in sea grass ecosystems, compared to nearby areas with no sea grass, about 65% of the time.
The study didn’t investigate the effects of higher pH on marine organisms—that’s a question for future research. But there’s reason to believe these meadows may have a positive influence on shellfish and other ocean animals.
“What we know is that a decrease in pH of 0.1 [is] already relevant for organisms,” Ricart said. “It will impact them in a negative way, it will impact their physiology, it can impact their behavior.”
If sea grass meadows can raise the water’s pH to more normal levels, they could help prevent some of these harmful effects, she suggested.
If that’s the case, protecting and restoring coastal vegetation could be a key strategy in combating ocean acidification. It’s not a substitute for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but it could be an extra tool to mitigate the damage that’s already been done.
The new study isn’t the first of its kind. Previous research has pointed to similar effects in sea grass meadows, kelp forests and other vegetation in coastal ecosystems around the world.
One recent study in the Chesapeake Bay found that sea grasses there produce a chemical compound called calcium carbonate, which combats ocean acidification. The study also found that these calcium carbonate particles can be swept downstream, spreading the chemical compound’s effects to other locations.
Other studies on the West Coast and in the Mediterranean Sea have also had promising results.
“Of course more studies are needed,” Ricart said. “But yeah, it’s exciting to see that different research groups in different countries are all kind of seeing the same. That’s very promising.”

'Insider Guide to Portugal’s Southern Coastwas written by Janelle Nanos and Published September by National Geographic. Enjoy! 

Portugal is made for wanderers. From the top of the Moorish remnants of Castelo de São Jorge, Lisbon cascades downhill in all directions, new paths beckoning at every turn. Surf camps dot the 215-mile stretch south of the storied capital city. Part of the region known as the Alentejo, this shore is far quieter than the Algarve beaches at the country’s southern edge.
Visitors would be wise to allot at least three days to leisurely explore the southwestern coast. Here are a few recommendations to get you started.
> How to Get Around:
Most rental car agencies in Europe offer manual transmission cars at lower prices than those with automatic transmissions.
If GPS isn’t available (even companies that promise navigational systems don’t always deliver), head to the Rent-a-Stuff centerRent-a-Stuff center at the Lisbon airport to rent a unit (around $17 a day). Tip: Ask about toll payment policies.
Atlantic Ferries takes passengers from Setúbal to the Tróia Peninsula. The ferries leave on the half hour and take about 30 minutes to cross (just under $20 a car).
> Where to Stay:
On the tip of the Tróia Peninsula sits the modish new Design Hotel, its building undulating like the waves breaking on the shore.
The Casas Brancas association partners with independent lodges and inns throughout the Alentejo and also provides a full list of surf schools, donkey treks, and mountain biking outfitters.
At the 21-room Herdade da Matinha, the owners prepare gourmet meals and also offer yoga classes, surf lessons, and horseback riding.
All but abandoned by its original occupants, Aldeia da Pedralva (a village near Vila do Bispo) has rebounded and restored its cottages for rental with terraces, barbecues, and courtyards.
> Where to Eat:
Several seafood restaurants perch on stilts in the harbor of Portinho da Arrábida, the small cove in the heart of Arrábida Natural Park. All are good, but Restaurante Beira Mar has the largest patio.
Claim a red pouf at Comporta’s beachside Ilha do Arroz, or visit Museu do Arroz, in an old rice-husking mill. Both serve salt-cod fish cakes, stews brimming with clam and shrimp, and blueberry-cachaça caipiroskas.
In Vila Nova de Milfontes, Restaurante A Choupana offers ocean views among Portugal’s best; order the clams. Down in Zambujeira do Mar, traditional fishermen’s tavern O Sacas serves spider crab, barnacles, and fried moray eel.
> The Ultimate Authentic Experience: Lisbon’s Sweet Spot
No visit to the capital’s Belém district is complete without sampling its famous custard tarts, pastéis de nata, said to have been first whipped up by 17th-century nuns at the Jerónimos Monastery.
Join the line snaking out the door at historic Antiga Confeitaria de Belém (aka Pastéis de Belém). Dusted with cinnamon and sugar, each egg-and-cream treat can be devoured in three bites—so order accordingly.

New federal science education standards adopted in Vermont require that students learn about climate change. So teachers are starting to create lesson plans with hands-on activities about weather patterns.
Credit Charlotte Albright / VPR / VPR The Northwoods Stewardship Center in East Charleston offers workshops for science teachers and advice for woodlot owners.
Some are getting that training deep in the woods of the Northeast Kingdom.
The Northwoods Stewardship Center is nearly hidden in 1,500 acres of forest. Its mission is to educate landowners and young people about how to conserve forest land.
About eight local science teachers take a muddy walk on a brisk fall day to learn about climate change. They see how some trees are thriving at the expense of others, and how a former farm is returning to woodland.
Credit Charlotte Albright / VPR / VPR Maria Young, right, of the Northwoods Stewardship Center, takes local science teachers on an educational stroll through the woods.
The question is, how will changing temperatures affect that botanical evolution?
Inside the rustic wooden center, operations director Jason Benoit talks about how warming temperatures are affecting northern zones.
“Certainly temperature change is one, but there’s a lot of secondary effects," he says. "For instance, soil drying [is] the big one. And just the number of cool days … because species like sugar maple, for instance, needs three months of cold in order to germinate."
Invasive insects are another new threat, he adds.
Lyndon State College meteorology professor Bruce Berryman paints a more global picture in his PowerPoint lecture. He says even if we reversed the harmful effects of carbon pollution today, it could take centuries for the earth to recover. Berryman admits that teaching about climate change can upset some skeptical school boards and parents.

“You need to be really careful what you say in the classroom because they go home and tell their parents, and the parents can just not be happy,” he warns.
But Berryman says it’s crucial to teach future generations about how increased energy in the earth’s atmosphere is leading to unprecedented storms — even if that news sometimes depresses kids so much that they become apathetic. The education director of the Northwoods Stewardship Center, Maria Young, says one solution to that problem is to hold classes outdoors. If students can see, feel, even smell their environment, she says, they will want to protect it.
“And through that starts learning and breaking down misconceptions,” Young says. “But it really is at the dirt level or the ground level, and that part is not depressing at all.”
But it’s not all about dirt. A lesson plan can literally be up in the air. Teachers visiting the center learn how budding scientists can use everyday school supplies to construct anemometers that can measure wind speed.
Irasburg Elementary science teachers Kristi LaFleur and Katrina McCullough stick a paper cup on a pencil base and make a pinwheel from straws.
"We’re reinforcing our straws so they don’t bend,” they say, putting their contraption together.
It’s supposed to withstand the gale force wind from a hair dryer, and it does — sort of.
As paper cup pinwheels spin around, teachers holding stopwatches count rotations per minute. Projects like this, they hope, will encourage science students to learn about how weather is changing — around the globe, and in their own backyards.

National Fish Hatcheries(NFH) develop and maintain brood stocks of selected fish strains with our primary focus on native species such as Lake trout, Pallid sturgeon, Coaster brook trout, Lake sturgeon, and Paddlefish. Hatcheries also provide technical assistance and sources of fish and eggs to cooperating agencies in pursuit of their aquatic resource management goals, provide fish and eggs for research, stock fish and eggs as part of native fish restoration programs, stock fish in fulfillment of federal obligations and assist with restoration of native endangered mussels such as the Higgins' eye pearlymussel and Winged mapleleaf mussel.
Over the years, 43 hatcheries have operated in the Midwest Region. The very first hatchery was established in 1880 in Northville, Michigan; operations ceased there in 1957. Currently, the Midwest Region boasts the oldest operational National Fish Hatchery in the country, Neosho NFH, located in Neosho, Missouri, which was established in 1888.
Midwest Hatcheries raise from twenty-four to twenty-six species of fish and mussels and produce 8,119,000 fish and 6,393,000 eggs in 2002. One of our hatcheries, Genoa NFH, is also an isolation facility.

The oil spill disaster on the Kalamazoo River got many in Michigan wondering about the state of Michigan's oil and gas pipelines.
In particular, people want to know more about the 61-year old Enbridge oil pipeline crossing the Straits of Mackinac.
Enbridge says the pipeline in the Straits is in fine shape. A break in that pipeline could be a catastrophe for the Great Lakes.
Ken Winter and James Hill have an idea they think could protect the Great Lakes from oil spills. They say a "market-based" approach will work.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Endangered Whooping Cranes Depart on Ultralight-guided Flight to Florida
Six young whooping cranes began their ultralight-led migration Friday from the White River Marsh State Wildlife Area in Green Lake County, Wis. This is the 12th group of birds to take part in a project led by the Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership (WCEP), an international coalition of public and private groups that is reintroducing this highly imperiled species in eastern North America, part of its historic range.
WCEP partner Operation Migration will use two ultralight aircraft to lead the juvenile cranes through Wisconsin, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia to reach the birds’ wintering habitat at St. Marks National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) along Florida's Gulf Coast. The cranes are currently in Columbia County, Wis.
“Despite the fact that we have done this before, each year we learn something new about these wonderful birds,” said Joe Duff, CEO of Operation Migration and leader of the ultralight team. “This year's flock seems more attentive, and we hope to make better progress. Our target is to arrive in Florida before Christmas.”
In addition to the six birds being led south by ultralights, biologists from WCEP partner, International Crane Foundation, are currently rearing six whooping crane chicks at Horicon NWR in Dodge County, Wis. The birds will be released later this fall in the company of older cranes from whom the young birds will learn the migration route south. This is the eighth year WCEP has used this Direct Autumn Release (DAR) method.
Whooping cranes that take part in the ultralight and DAR reintroductions are hatched at the U.S. Geological Survey’s Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Laurel, Md., and at the International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wis. Chicks are raised under a strict isolation protocol, and to ensure the birds remain wild, handlers adhere to a no-talking rule and wear costumes designed to mask the human form.
The 12 ultralight-led and DAR chicks are joining two wild-hatched chicks in the 2012 cohort. These two wild-raised chicks will follow their respective parents on migration. In addition to the 14 juvenile cranes, 102 whooping cranes are currently in the eastern migratory population.
Whooping cranes were on the verge of extinction in the 1940s. Today, there are only about 600 birds in existence, approximately 445 of them in the wild. Aside from the WCEP birds, the only other migratory population of whooping cranes nests at Wood Buffalo National Park in northern Alberta, Canada and winters at Aransas NWR on the Texas Gulf Coast. A non-migratory flock of approximately 20 birds lives year-round in the central Florida Kissimmee region, and an additional 17 non-migratory cranes live in southern Louisiana.
WCEP asks anyone who encounters a whooping crane in the wild to please give them the respect and distance they need. Do not approach birds on foot within 200 yards; remain in your vehicle; do not approach in a vehicle any closer than 100 yards. Also, please remain concealed and do not speak loudly enough that the birds can hear you. Finally, do not trespass on private property in an attempt to view or photograph whooping cranes.
Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership founding members are the International Crane Foundation, Operation Migration, Inc., Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Geological Survey’s Patuxent Wildlife Research Center and National Wildlife Health Center, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the Natural Resources Foundation of Wisconsin, and the International Whooping Crane Recovery Team.
Many other flyway states, provinces, private individuals and conservation groups have joined forces with and support WCEP by donating resources, funding and personnel. More than 60 percent of the project’s budget comes from private sources in the form of grants, public donations and corporate sponsors.

Midwesterners Receive National Endangered Species Recovery Champion Awards
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Acting Director Rowan Gould today announced the 18 recipients of the 2009 Recovery Champion award. Among them are the International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wisconsin; two Ohio conservationists working with the threatened Lake Erie watersnake; and a Service biologist who encouraged Iowa landowners to create and conserve habitat for the endangered Topeka shiner.
The Recovery Champion award recognizes U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service employees and their partners for contributions to the recovery of threatened and endangered species in the United States. Recognized from the Midwest for their work in 2009 were Dr. George Archibald and staff of the International Crane Foundation; Kristin Stanford and Dr. Richard King of Northern Illinois University; and Kraig McPeek, Service Private Lands biologist.
“The Recovery Champion award both recognizes the exceptional conservation accomplishments of its honorees and highlights the importance of strong and diverse partnerships in species conservation,” said Gould. “Recovery Champions are helping imperiled species regain their place in the natural resources fabric of our country while focusing attention on the importance of conserving our nation’s biological heritage for future generations.”
International Crane Foundation staff, and founder George Archibald, were recognized for their successful efforts to increase the captive population of the endangered whooping crane, and for developing innovative techniques rearing cranes in captivity for release without human imprinting. The Foundation has been a key player in the Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership, which is establishing a population of whooping cranes in the eastern United States through teaching young whoopers migrating routes by following ultralight aircraft.
“As part of the partnership, ICF has helped create a flock of more than 85 whooping cranes that migrate between Wisconsin and Florida,” said the Service’s Midwest Regional Director Tom Melius. “Their efforts are far-reaching – not just in the eastern states but throughout the entire whooping crane recovery program.”
Stanford and King received the Recovery Champion Award for their combined 35 years of work to conserve the threatened Lake Erie watersnake. King’s studies, which began in the 1980s, identified early population declines and threats to the species. Stanford, known as “The Snake Lady,” has worked tirelessly to reach out to residents of the Lake Erie islands where the snake is found, to provide an understanding of the snake’s needs and to build support for its conservation.
“The dedication of Ms. Stanford and Dr. King to the conservation of the Lake Erie watersnake, through both scientific methods and strong public involvement, has recovery efforts for this species to the point that the next step is to propose removing it from the list of endangered and threatened species. There is no greater measure of recovery success,” said Melius.
McPeek, now the Service’s Private Lands Coordinator for Ohio, was recognized for his efforts in Iowa to recover the Topeka shiner, an endangered fish. From 2005 to 2009, McPeek was instrumental facilitating restoration of almost 40 off-channel oxbows in habitats for the shiner. McPeek’s design for restored habitats had almost immediate results: follow-up surveys showed young Topeka shiners where none had previously occurred. Just as important were McPeek’s strong efforts to recruit large numbers of landowners who participated in shiner restoration efforts in Iowa’s North Raccoon River watershed.
“Kraig always goes the extra mile for the resource and for the landowners who made this habitat restoration effort so successful,” Melius said. “Kraig and his work are making huge contributions toward improving the Topeka shiner’s status and habitat in Iowa.”
All the 2009 Recovery Champion honorees are working across the nation to benefit a range of endangered and threatened plants and animals. From whooping cranes to mussels, Service employees and partners such as universities, conservation agencies, and private organizations are devoting their resources to a shared mission. Habitat restoration, public awareness campaigns, and species monitoring programs are just a few examples of this year’s Recovery Champion honorees’ efforts.

Baraboo Waterfowl Production Area, 967 acres, is part of the Leopold Pine Island Important Bird Area, 16,000 acres near the Wisconsin River and Baraboo River near Portage, Wisconsin.
This IBA is best viewed along 11 miles of Levee Road, in the locale made famous by Aldo Leopold in his book, Sand County Almanac.

Leopold Wetland Management District continues work with several partners, public and private, within the Leopold/Pine Island Important Bird Area. This 16,000-acre mix of grasslands, floodplain forest, wetlands, savanna and woodlands straddling the Wisconsin and Baraboo rivers began forming in 2004, when several partners proposed expanding the boundary of the Pine Island State Wildlife Area IBA. A breeding bird survey of the entire IBA, conducted in 2005, supplemented a similar survey conducted on Baraboo River WPA in 2001 and established a baseline for future monitoring as well as identified bird species and associated plant-animal communities for potential management focus. The result was the dedication of the IBA in 2007 and the development of the “Strategic Vision for Bird Conservation on the Leopold-Pine Island Important Bird Area”. The IBA report, as it’s known, serves as a grounding rod, identifying important habitats and focusing management actions that individual partners can undertake on their properties that will provide landscape-scale benefits to the IBA. Those partners currently include the Leopold Memorial Reserve, administered by the Aldo Leopold Foundation, Sand County Foundation, and private landowners; Pine Island State Wildlife Area, administered by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources; Baraboo River Waterfowl Production Area administered by U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS); Phill and Joan Pines Tract (private) with collaboration with Aldo Leopold Foundation; Wisconsin Waterfowl Association; and NRCS.

'Haywood K-5 students will return to in-person learningwas written by Hannah Mcleod by Smoky Mountain News. Please enjoy this Region Radio story! 

At a special called meeting of the Haywood County School Board Monday, Sept. 21, the board voted to approve Plan A for all elementary schools in Haywood County. This comes after North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper announced Friday, Sept. 17, that schools could choose to implement Plan A for elementary schools.
Plan A is full-time, in-person learning with no restrictions on the number of children in a classroom. The plan does includes safety guidelines like face coverings for all students, teachers and staff, social distancing and symptom screening.
“The social distancing is recommended at that age group [elementary] but not required. You can be closer than six feet under that plan, and you would need to be closer than six feet or they would not fit in the building,” said Superintendent Bill Nolte.
In the same vote that approved Plan A for elementary schools, the board approved the plan, previously decided upon, that middle and high school students would return to partial in-person learning Monday, Sept. 28. Middle and high school students will still be on the A week, B week rotation when in-person learning begins Sept. 28.
The board also approved the scheduling of one mandatory teacher workday for teachers before in-person learning begins. The mandatory teacher workday will be Friday, Sept. 25, for middle and high school teachers, and Friday, Oct. 2, for elementary school teachers.
In addition to Plan A for elementary students and Plan B for middle and high school students, a fully remote option will be available for the rest of the 2020-21 school year for any student that wants it.
The superintendent presented three plans for the board’s consideration at the special called meeting. The first option was to bring all students back for Plan B starting on Monday, Sept. 28, as originally planned, and move elementary students into Plan A on Oct. 5. The second option would start elementary students back on Plan A as well as middle and high school students on Plan B, all on Oct. 5. The board decided on the third option, to start middle and high school students on Plan B on Sept. 28 and elementary students on Plan A on Oct. 5.
“All of these will work, the question is which one’s better right now, for us,” said Nolte.
Ultimately, the board wanted students to get back to in-person learning as soon as possible. This was the deciding factor in choosing the third option presented by Nolte.
“One of the things that has been frustrating for us as we have done our planning, we have spent a lot of time planning to do option C, and we have done it pretty well since school started. We have spent a lot of time planning for option B, and we think we can do that when we’re ready. At the last meeting we said we would do that by the 28th. We spent some time planning for option A. But what we have not done, and it’s a little frustrating is, plan for the governor to give us two plans at once: one plan for half of our students and the other plan for the other half of our students,” said Nolte.
Administration had previously organized bus transportation under Plan B but are still working on a layout for Plan A. Associate Superintendent Trevor Putnam said he was certain they could figure it out by the Oct. 5 start date for elementary schools.

Today, Director Dan Ashe checks in from Madison, Wisconsin....
After more than a year of planning and anticipation, Conserving the Future: National Wildlife Refuges and the Next Generation is here.
When I got here yesterday, I was greeted with dark clouds and claps of thunder. Some might think this was an inauspicious beginning, but I thought it was perfect, an exciting start to our history-making event.
A lot has changed since the last time we did this. In 1999, Fulfulling the Promise became the National Wildlife Refuge System’s guiding vision.
Today, we face more – and more complex – conservation challenges. There’s the U.S. population – more urban, older and more diverse -- that has grown by 58 million in the past 20 years. There are increasing threats to fish, wildlife and habitats and the added challenge of a changing climate. Add to these the rapid changes in communication fostered by the web and social media.
That’s why we’re here. We’re here in Madison, Wisconsin, where Aldo Leopold, as a professor at the University of Wisconsin, formed the school’s wildlife management program and wrote the essays that would become A Sand County Almanac.
Our conference site, the ? ?Monona Terrace Community Conference Center?, is designated LEED silver by the U.S. Green Building Council. It’s a facility that purchases its electricity from renewable sources, mainly wind power. By holding the event here I’m proud to say we’ve been able to limit our carbon footprint.
So, today’s the day. Whether you’re in Madison or participating online, it’s the right time and the right place to form a new vision for our beloved National Wildlife Refuge System.
This is our charge, our shared responsibility.
Faced with this responsibility, we must be creative. We must inspire one another and work together.
Think partnerships. We know we’re on the right track if our goals require collaboration.
Think youth. We must engage our young people and help them lead the future of conservation in America.
This won’t be easy. Change never is.
Challenges aside, I’m excited for another day. Yesterday, after the rain finally stopped, the sun came out and it was a beautiful summer day. A great beginning to what promises to be a great week.
The challenges – and the opportunities – are here and now. It’s the right time, and we’re in the right place.
Give it your all.

The image was taken at the Yerkes Observatory in Williams Bay, Wisconsin. Yerkes has the largest refracting telescope—all glass lenses, no mirrors—in the world. It also has been the home for numerous astronomical discoveries and a place of research for famous individuals such as Edwin Hubble, Carl Sagan, and Albert Einstein (pictured below). Yerkes was founded in 1897, and the main telescope is still in use today. The telescope has produced over 150,000 photographic plates, some of which are included in the August 1919 National Geographic magazine story.

The original article, entitled “Exploring the Glories of the Firmament,” by William Joseph Showalter, takes its readers on a tour of the solar system with “first person” accounts from various stars and planets. This, from Neptune:
“If you please, sir, I long flattered myself with the thought that I was an uncle that you Earth-ites never knew you had. I am an elder brother of Mother Earth, though for ages and ages she and her children never suspected my existence.
But back in the ‘forties’ of the nineteenth century my brother Uranus overtook me in our Marathon around the sun. Though our track is a billion miles wide and he has the rail, yet whenever he passes me I fret him so much that he gets a case of ‘nerves.’”
Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.
Although the language of the writer is reminiscent of a different time, much of what he expresses still rings true today:
“It is interesting to have a look at our own earth in its relation to the worlds that people the sky. When a mighty storm sweeps over the ocean, when a great war devastates a continent, when a Katmai [volcano] blows off her head, when an earthquake destroys a populous city, men stand overwhelmed and awed at the spectacle!
But how little and insignificant are such forces, measured by the majestic might of the earth as it sweeps on its course around the sun!”

Whether it’s the dreamy-looking black-and-white photographic plates of distant stars or images of the artfully constructed telescope, it’s hard not to feel a sense of awe. Places like Yerkes bring us closer to worlds beyond our own imaginations.

Not so long ago the black-capped vireo nearly went extinct. Goats ate their way through this songbird’s habitat and brown-headed cowbirds commandeered their nests. In the late 1980s there were only about 350 birds known to exist, leading to its listing as endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). There are now more than 14,000 birds estimated across the vireo’s breeding range of Oklahoma, Texas and Mexico. Today the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced the delisting of the black-capped vireo at Balcones Canyonlands National Wildlife Refuge. The delisting of the black-capped vireo would not have been possible without the efforts of our partners including the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation, USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service, Fort Hood, Fort Sill Army Base, Mexico, The Nature Conservancy, Environmental Defense Fund, private landowners and others.

Gateway Airport: Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport
Using Anchorage as a hub, these out-and-back drives lead to three huge national parks and some of the world’s most expansive and spectacular wilderness scenery.
The country’s largest national park represents everything that is compelling about Alaska. It is vast—bigger than Switzerland. It showcases towering mountains (Mount St. Elias stands 18,008 feet tall) and accessible glaciers. The state’s human history is on display in the historic mining communities of McCarthy and Kennicott. And, appropriate for Alaska, getting there is an adventure: a long day’s drive to reach a 59-mile gravel road that leads to the heart of the park. (If you rent a car, be sure the agency permits travel on gravel roads.)
The Route: Anchorage > Alaska 1 (Glenn Highway) > Alaska 10 (Edgerton Highway) > McCarthy Road > Wrangell-St. Elias
On the Way: Be sure to stop at the park’s main visitor center, located outside the park in Copper Center, for the latest on road conditions as well as maps and books.
At approximately mile 17 on McCarthy Road you’ll cross the Kuskulana Bridge, a picturesque trestle bridge built in 1910 to serve the railroad. It spans a canyon and towers 238 feet above the raging muddy water of the Kuskulana River.
Stay: Kennicott Glacier Lodge is a modern hotel built in 1987 in the spirit of the ghost-town mining village of Kennicott. The 25-room lodge has views of the Chugach and Wrangell Mountains, and the Kennicott-Root Glacier confluence is so close you can hear the trickling of glacial meltwater. To get there, leave your car in McCarthy, walk across the Kennicott River on a footbridge, and meet the lodge shuttle for the five-mile drive. Rates start at $185 a night.
Eat: The McCarthy Lodge dining room surprises visitors with its emphasis on local foods, such as wild Copper River red salmon, and fresh ingredients, including greenhouse-grown vegetables.
Don’t Miss: Even if you stay in Kennicott, be sure to spend time in McCarthy. Stroll its few streets to get a sense of what it’s like to live in a true Alaskan bush community, and visit its little local-history museum to get a sense of life here during the heyday of copper mining nearly a century ago.
If the weather’s clear, get up high with Wrangell Mountain Air, based in McCarthy. Only on a flightseeing tour can you begin to appreciate the vastness of the Wrangell-St. Elias wilderness.
Jaw-Dropping Viewpoints: You can’t do better than the terrace of Kennicott Lodge, with its view of Kennicott and Root Glaciers and a dramatic mountain backdrop—unless you walk up a little higher toward Bonanza and Jumbo mines for an even better view.
Walks
Easy: Get face-to-face with a glacier by taking the two-mile Root Glacier trail up the lateral moraines of the Kennicott and Root Glaciers before reaching the Root. Even better, do it with St. Elias Alpine Guides, who will provide crampons and guide you out onto the ice. Moderate: Hike the steep uphill trail past an old tram system to the ruins of Bonanza Mine (4.5 miles), or to Jumbo Mine (5 miles), where you can see old mine buildings and tools and gain great views of the Kennicott Valley.
Side Drive: In the far north part of the park, the gravel Slana-Nabesna Road runs 42 miles. Great views of the Wrangell Mountains open up as you proceed south. The other prime attraction: solitude, in a little-visited part of the park. Be sure to check with the visitor center regarding road conditions before embarking on this drive.
Oddity: How did they do it? That’s the question that comes to mind when you glean the extent of the mining operations around McCarthy and Kennicott—amazing feats of construction, massive timbers and machinery, and particularly a railroad that crossed a glacier and penetrated such rugged country.
Before You Come: Read, and admire the photos in, My Wrangell Mountains by photographer Ruedi Homberger, who documents the Wrangell-St. Elias wilderness from the air and from the summits of the mountains.

Seasonal Notes: Highways to the park are plowed year-round, but the park road to McCarthy doesn’t open until early May. Lodges in the park are open from late May to mid-September.
Kenai Fjords is a place of ice and water. The massive Harding Icefield overlays much of the park, and dozens of glaciers branch from it, many of them flowing into the glacially carved fjords that give the park its name. This may not sound like an ideal formula for a driving tour, but the drive to the park is spectacular, and once you’re there, boat and kayak operators take over and guide you to the park’s dramatic land and seascapes.
The Route: Anchorage > Alaska 1 (Seward Highway) > Alaska 9 (Seward Highway) > Kenai Fjords
On the Way: As you drive down from Anchorage between Turnagain Arm and the rugged mountains of Chugach State Park, keep an eye peeled on those rises for mountain goats.
Stop off to see beautiful Portage Lake and Portage Glacier in Chugach National Forest. At Mile 55, turn left on Portage Glacier Highway, continue five miles, and then turn right at the sign for the Begich, Boggs Visitor Center, which is right on the lake. There you can buy tickets for a boat ride that takes you near the mouth of the glacier.
Stay: Kenai Fjords Glacier Lodge, a wilderness lodge on a private inholding on Aialik Bay, is the only lodging within the park. It is set on the shore of a protected lagoon with a view of Pederson Glacier and is reachable only by boat with Alaska Wildland Adventures. A two-day, one night package is $695.
Eat: The larger tour boats that serve the park have generous buffets that inevitably include fresh Alaska salmon. In Seward, gateway to the park, fresh seafood is everywhere.
Don’t Miss: A boat tour is the way to behold the extent of the beauty of the park’s fjords and glaciers. Take a full-day tour to reach such massive tidewater glaciers as Aialik and Holgate. You might witness them calving. Along the way you’ll see abundant seabirds, sea lions, and, very likely, whales. The park website lists boat-tour operators.
Jaw-Dropping Viewpoint: Even if you’re not up to the challenging four-mile climb to the top of the Harding Icefield Trail, go up a mile and a half or so for a stunning view of the valley that contains the terminus of the Exit Glacier.
Walks
Easy: Exit Glacier is the only glacier in the park you can drive and hike to. Short trails begin at the Exit Glacier Nature Center and lead to a view of the glacier (0.5 miles), the toe of the glacier (1 mile), or the edge of the glacier (1.2 miles). Signs along the way indicate the rate at which the glacier has receded. Challenging: In the course of a steep, steady ascent of the four-mile Harding Icefield Trail, you enter the frigid realm of the Pleistocene Epoch, or what’s left of it. You’ll skirt Exit Glacier along the way, and hear its cracking ice. But reaching the Harding Icefield is the real payoff—700 square miles of the same glacial ice that blanketed much of south-central Alaska thousands of years ago.
Side Drive: Although the little harbor town of Whittier is not in the park, a side trip there is worthwhile, especially on a clear day when you can appreciate the town’s setting on Prince William Sound.
Oddity: The drive and walk to Exit Glacier is a passage back through time—first through mature Alaska forest, then through alders and shrubs, and then to the ice itself, dating from the Pleistocene epoch. Signs along the way tell the story.
Before You Come: Read A Stern and Rock-Bound Coast by Linda Cook and Frank Norris.

Seasonal Notes: Boat tours and lodging operate only in summer, but the Exit Glacier part of the park is open in winter for cross-country skiing, snowshoeing, and dogsledding.
Long before “awesome” got downgraded to describe a decent burger, Denali (aka Mount McKinley) practically owned the word. The continent’s highest peak (20,320 feet) is such a dominant presence in six-million-acre Denali National Park that you feel it even when the mountain is shrouded in clouds, which is two-thirds of the time. Whether or not the clouds lift, the drive from Anchorage is thrilling, and the drive through the park—which you’ll hand over to the park’s shuttle drivers—gives you a sense of the expansiveness of the land that surrounds the massive mountain.
The Route: Anchorage > Alaska 3 > Denali
On the Way: Take a 15-mile detour to the town of Talkeetna, mustering place for Denali climbers and a lunch stop with plentiful options. Denali State Park has great hiking and, at the Veterans Memorial inside the park, an excellent view of Denali.
Stay: Camp Denali, deep inside the park, has high-ceilinged, woodstove-heated pine cabins scattered across 67 mountain-view acres, and a short walk to showers and facilities gives you a slight sense of roughing it. $1,635 for three nights, all-inclusive.
Eat: About ten miles south of the park entrance on Alaska 3 is 229 Parks, which serves creative alternatives to the usual salmon-bake fare, and utilizes fresh, locally sourced ingredients.
Don’t Miss: There’s no better way to digest the scope of the mountain and park than to see them from the air. Several air taxi services run flights out of the main park entrance and from Talkeetna.
Taking the shuttle through the park on the sole road that traverses Denali is a must. But don’t just sit on the bus to the end of the line. Get off almost anywhere along the way and take a walk—the Polychrome Overlook area, for example—and pick up a later bus to complete your passage through the park.
Jaw-Dropping Viewpoints: The views are endless along the park road, but one that is exceptional is one you can drive to—Mountain Vista Trailhead at Mile 13. What do you see? The great mountain, of course, if the clouds cooperate.
Walks: Denali is unusual in that it has very few trails. Walking here is mainly a cross-country proposition. You can hop off the park shuttle anywhere and flag down another one after your hike. Your best bets are places where gravel river bars make for reasonably easy going—for example, the Toklat River at Mile 53. Consult rangers at the park visitor center for further suggestions.
Side Drive: Although the full length of the 92-mile park road is closed to private vehicles, you can drive as far as Savage River (Mile 14), where there’s a parking area and a trail paralleling the river on which you gain a quick sense of isolation.
Oddity: Denali has the only working dogsled team in the National Park Service. In winter, they run patrols and deliver researchers and supplies into the wilderness. In summer, rangers train the dogs (Alaskan huskies, of course) and run demos (using sleds with rollers) for visitors several times a day. The kennels are 1.5 miles from the visitor center. You can walk or catch a shuttle bus.
Before You Come: This year marks the 100th anniversary of the first ascent of Denali, making Hudson Stuck’s account of that climb, The Ascent of Denali, a timely read. If that climb sounds like a walk in the park, read Art Davidson’s Minus 148°, an account of the first winter ascent of the mountain.

Seasonal Notes: The park is open year-round, although the park road is plowed only as far as park headquarters. The park shuttles operate from May 20 through the second Thursday after Labor Day. Lodge facilities in and near the park are open approximately those same dates.

Growing Up Wisconsin
By Heather Jerue
Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge Wisconsin Gary J. Wege
The crisp, refreshing outdoors of Wisconsin has been in my blood since I was a girl. It was an integral part of my life growing up. But I didnt fully realize the rich conservation history and ethic of my home state until I went to college.
Many people hesitate when a new acquaintance asks, Where are you from? Such people think twice before naming their university town or the most recent place they have lived. Not me. There is no uncertainty. For me, its easy. I promptly and proudly say, Im from LaCrosse, Wisconsin.
I know how lucky I am to have been raised in such a great placenot only because of the citys remarkable sense of community, but also because of the areas absolute natural beauty. LaCrosse is nestled among the bluffs where three great riversthe Black, the LaCrosse and the Mississippi converge on Wisconsins west coast. And LaCrosse is situated on the longest river refuge in the Lower 48 states, the Upper Mississippi River National Wildlife and Fish Refuge.
Whether I was playing in our backyard, attending summer camp, camping with my family or fishing with my dad, the outdoors was an important part of my childhood.
Hunting and fishing wereand still arebonding experiences for our whole family. Typically, we would go out on Lake Onalaska to catch bluegill. It could be on open water or ice fishing. In summer, my mom would come along for the boat ride, or read while the rest of us fished. It was together time. And, by the way, Dad makes the best bluegill fish tacos in the world.
He and my two brothers are avid hunters, tooduck, turkey, deer. Every Christmas, they give one another hunting and fishing gear. Whether the gifts are deer cams, duck decoys or turkey calls, the three of them tend to geek out over them while Mom and I goodnaturedly look on.
Dad instilled in all of us kids a healthy respect for and love of the outdoors. While our family regularly hunted and fished near the refuge, Dad taught us that the refuge itself was and is a sanctuary, a place where wildlife is safe and protected.
It wasnt until I moved a few hours southeast to Madison to study at the University of Wisconsin, though, that I began to truly appreciate the considerable conservation heritage of my home state. There I learned, of course, about Aldo Leopold, a professor at the University Wisconsin in the 1930s and 40s who formed the schools wildlife management program, wrote A Sand County Almanac and became the father of the land ethic. I learned, too, about Gaylord Nelson and John Muir. Nelson, a former governor and U.S. senator who grew up in Clear Lake, WI, was the principal founder of Earth Day. Muir, the legendary conservationist who founded the Sierra Club, was born in Scotland but immigrated with his family at age 11 to Portage, WI, where he spent his formative years before attending the University of Wisconsin.
I cant imagine a better place to hold the Conserving the Future: Wildlife Refuges and the Next Generation conference than Madison. Having the legacies of Leopold, Nelson and Muirand the invigorating outdoors of Wisconsinas backdrops makes this environmentfriendly city the perfect setting for conservationists to gather to discuss the future of our national wildlife refuges.
Everything about this conference makes me feel right at home.

It's been a brutal year for public lands.
At the beginning of December, President Donald Trump removed federal protections from two national monuments, ordering the largest reduction of public lands protections in U.S. history. These outrageous actions did not happen in isolation; they were the latest in a larger pattern of Trump administration rules and policies undermining America’s national parks and public lands.
What has the year been like for our public lands? Pretty brutal. This administration has made more than 30 dangerous and destructive decisions about America’s public lands in 2017. Here is NPCA’s new video on many of these terrible actions, and details on 10 of the “lowlights.”
1. January 23: Short-staffing parks
By: President Trump
Just days after taking office, President Trump issued a hiring freeze on federal civilian employees, including National Park Service staff, that lasted through mid-April. National parks already had 10 percent fewer rangers and other staff than they did a few years ago, despite contending with record-breaking crowds, and this temporary measure significantly hampered park staffing.
2. February 28: Rolling back water protections
By: President Trump
President Trump issued an executive order to review the Clean Water Rule, leading to a June 27 decision to repeal the rule. The rule provides clear and predictable protections for many streams, wetlands and other waterways that are essential to the health of our parks and communities.
3. March 28: Prioritizing energy production over park protection
By: President Trump
This one was a doozy. President Trump issued a sweeping executive order on “energy independence” with numerous negative consequences for public lands. It ordered, among other things:
The Department of the Interior to review safety and enforcement standards that protect more than 40 national parks from the impacts of oil and gas drilling inside their boundaries
The Environmental Protection Agency to withdraw and rewrite rules that mandate power plants limit carbon dioxide
Federal agencies to no longer consider the effects of climate change when deciding whether to issue permits for fossil fuel production
Both the EPA and Bureau of Land Management to delay enacting standards to reduce methane pollution from oil and gas operations
4. April 5: Pumping water out of the desert
By: The Department of the Interior
The Department of the Interior took steps that could lead to the approval of the controversial Cadiz Inc. groundwater mining proposal, a destructive project that would pump 16 billion gallons of water per year from the Mojave Desert, affecting Mojave National Preserve and Mojave Trails National Monument.
5. April 26: Attacking national monuments
By: President Trump
President Trump issued an executive order requiring the Department of the Interior to review 27 national monuments designated by the Antiquities Act, going as far back as 1996, to recommend potential changes.
6. April 28: Opening more land to drilling
By: President Trump
President Trump issued an executive order calling on the Department of the Interior to consider granting energy developers access to areas previously closed to offshore oil and gas drilling, threatening coastal parks and marine wildlife. It also calls on the Department of Commerce to refrain from designating or expanding any national marine sanctuary until it is evaluated for energy resource potential, and to review any marine sanctuaries or monuments established over the last 10 years.
7. July 6: Allowing power lines at Jamestown
By: The Army Corps of Engineers
The Army Corps of Engineers granted a permit for Dominion Virginia Power to build 17 giant transmission towers across the James River. The project would permanently mar historic Jamestown, site of the country’s first permanent English settlement.
8. August 31: Ignoring climate change in park management
By: The National Park Service
The National Park Service rescinded Director’s Order 100. This order, enacted in 2016, directs the agency to use comprehensive, science-based management practices to combat climate change, biodiversity loss, invasive species, pollution and other threats to national parks. By repealing the measure, the agency is removing scientific considerations from its management practices.
9. October 10: Repealing the Clean Power Plan
By: The Environmental Protection Agency
The Environmental Protection Agency moved to repeal the Clean Power Plan, a comprehensive plan to reduce emissions from energy development and improve conservation measures to combat climate change, the number one threat to national parks.
10. December 4: Eliminating national monuments
By: President Trump and the Department of the Interior
On the recommendation of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, President Trump signed proclamations removing protections from more than 2 million acres of national monument land at Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monuments, opening up previously protected land to potential drilling, mining and logging.
And that’s not all. Read NPCA’s year-end policy update detailing all 30 of the attacks this administration has made on America’s national parks and public lands.
Fortunately, NPCA has been fighting for national parks for nearly 100 years, and we aren’t going to stop after one year of setbacks. None of these actions are a done deal, and we are continuing to work passionately to undo the damage and restore protections for America’s most inspirational places. Thank you for being part of this fight.

Now it's time for a story about Mendelssohn Club. Mendelssohn Club will be coming up in 173.72 miles, and can be found 2.89 miles from the route to the southwest or right.

Guy'S Degrees Are In Music, He Spent A Number Of Years As A Classical Host On Wniu.

After more than 40 years in Rockford as an independent organization, Charlotte’s Web for the Performing Arts is becoming a division of the Mendelssohn Performing Arts Center.
Charlotte’s Web for the Performing Arts has long been known for presenting an eclectic mix of folk, blues and other types of ‘roots’ music. For most of its 128 years, the focus of what is now the Mendelssohn Performing Arts Center has been classical music.
Lani Richardson is the Web’s executive director. She took over the post a few years ago from her mother, Karen Howard, who’d led it for most of its existence. Richardson says she had wanted to make sure the Web could continue, without relying so much on her family.
“We’d do everything because there aren’t the resources within Charlotte’s Web to have somebody to do the taxes, to have somebody to do the marketing, to have somebody to do the booking.”
Richardson says joining with Mendelssohn, and the support it brings with it, will enable the Web to continue as an institution, independent of any individual.
“This partnership, in my mind, really feels like a safe home for the legacy that is Charlotte’s Web.”
Beverly Broyles is Mendelssohn’s executive director. She says several years ago, the organization made a conscious decision to move beyond its classical music club origins. Adding the Web fits that goal.
“Taking Charlotte’s Web into our home would broaden our ability to present a wider range of musical genre. It would give us [an] opportunity to expand educational programs.”
Broyles says the move also creates the opportunity for cross-pollination between the two organizations, and their audiences.
The Web has partnered with Mendelssohn on projects for some time. Richardson says they’re a good match because both share a determination to maintain high standards of programming and performance.
Broyles says the combination will be greater than the sum of its parts- and believes it will be a strong and vital part of the community.
“Together, we’re just going to be able to provide our community in Rockford and beyond a rich diversity of music opportunities and performances.”
Charlotte’s Web begins its 41st season, its first as a part of the Mendelssohn Performing Art Center, on Friday, September 14,th at the Emerson House with folk singer Sara McQuaid.

This next story is about Elgin Public Museum. Elgin History Museum will be coming up in 204.15 miles, and can be found 1.74 miles from the route to the south or right. 'Greece Unveils Museum Meant For 'Stolen' Sculptureswas written by Sylvia Poggioli by NPR. Hope you like it! 

Greece Unveils Museum Meant For 'Stolen' Sculptures

A new, hypermodern museum at the foot of the Acropolis in Athens has a defiant purpose: to convince Britain to give back the symbols of ancient Greek glory, the 2,500-year-old sculptures of the Parthenon that were pried off the temple by Lord Elgin two centuries ago.
For decades, the main argument against the return of the sculptures — known as the Elgin or Parthenon Marbles — was Greece's lack of a suitable location for their display. The new Acropolis Museum is a stunning rebuttal.
Designed by Swiss-American architect Bernard Tschumi, the five-story building has an area of 226,000 square feet. Its glass-covered exterior walls reflect the images of the Parthenon and surrounding ruins.
Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Nikos Daniilidis/Acropolis Museum Courtesy of Nikos Daniilidis/Acropolis Museum
The museum is the new home for hundreds of statues from the Archaic and Classical eras. Randomly distributed on the floor of a large gallery, the statues appear as if they are part of a crowd milling in the public square, giving visitors one-on-one, close-up contact with the marble ancients.
But the top floor, the Parthenon Gallery, is the museum's showcase, says archaeologist Naya Charmalia, a member of the museum's exhibition team.
"This is the crown of the building, a glass box and glass surfaces, because the major requirement was the visual link to the Acropolis. You can see the monument and at the same time the sculptures from the monument," Charmalia says.
'Everyone Understands What Is Missing'
The display space is the same dimension and orientation as the Parthenon looming on the Acropolis hill, just 900 feet away. Thanks to wraparound glass windows, the exhibits bask in the same natural light surrounding the original temple, which was built for the goddess Athena, the protector of the city of Athens below.
Britain's Lord Elgin chiseled off roughly half the sculptures that adorned the Parthenon in the early 1800s, when Greece was an unwilling member of the Ottoman Empire. Later, he sold them to the British Museum.
At the new museum, plaster casts of the sculptures housed in London are interspersed with original pieces Elgin left behind.
Charmalia says the contrast between the stark white plaster and the ancient honey-colored stone has a specific purpose.
"Everyone understands at once what is missing, because if you say numbers, you can't understand, but you can see how many are missing," she says.
Extending for 525 feet, the sculptures of the temple's frieze depict a festival honoring Athena, a procession of worshippers performing rituals, and musical and athletic contests.
Other parts of the temple's exterior — the metopes and pediments — depict legendary battles and mythological scenes.
While pressure on the British Museum has increased, its spokeswoman, Hannah Boulton, firmly rejects repatriating the chiseled marbles to Greece.
Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Nikos Daniilidis/Acropolis Museum Courtesy of Nikos Daniilidis/Acropolis Museum
"They are now museum objects. They are objects of world art. And as such, there is no problem in terms of them being divided between two different museums and telling two different, but complementary stories," she says.
Issue Of National And Cultural Pride
Nevertheless, Acropolis Museum director Dimitrios Pandermalis says his aim is to reunify the entire composition close to its original setting.
"We have from the same figure, half of the body in Athens, half of the body in London. We have a body in London and a head in Athens. We have horses in London, and the tails of the horses are in Athens. It is a moral problem in art of divided monuments," he says.
British Museum officials concede that it could loan some of the sculptures, as long as Greece recognizes its ownership of the artifacts. It's a proposal Pandermalis rejects.
"They don't belong to the British, they don't belong to us. They belong to history. They are not pieces of trade," he says.
The campaign for the return of the sculptures is part of the international debate over ownership of cultural property.
For Greeks, the return of the Parthenon Marbles is an issue of national and cultural pride.
Maro Kakridi-Ferrari, professor in the philosophy department of Athens University, says the Parthenon — and what it symbolizes — were traumatized by the sculptures' removal.
"They are the material proof of what democracy has built in Athens of the Classical period," she says. "They are identified with the glory of ancient Greece, and they are part of the national identity."

'The Economic Legacy Of Atlanta's Olympicswas written by Kathy Lohr and was published on August 04, 2011 by NPR. Hope you enjoy! 

The Economic Legacy Of Atlanta's Olympic Games
Enlarge this image toggle caption John Bazemore/AP John Bazemore/AP
Bringing the 1996 Summer Olympic Games to Atlanta was a long shot. Athens, Greece, was the sentimental favorite to host the centennial games, and tension was palpable as IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch made the announcement back on Sept. 18, 1990.
"The International Olympic Committee has awarded the 1996 Olympic Games to the city of ... Atlanta," Samaranch revealed.
That announcement launched more than $1 billion of construction projects, from Olympic venues to housing for the athletes. Now, on the 15th anniversary of the games, Atlanta sees both gains and losses from the international event.
One of the most prominent legacies of the games is Centennial Olympic Park in the heart of Atlanta. The 21-acre plaza glistens in what was an area of urban decay, and children run and linger in the fountain.
Harvey Newman, a professor of public policy at Georgia State University, says the park brought economic development downtown.
"The area surrounding the park has added major hotels, condominiums, new office structures and, of course, people continue to flock to enjoy the Olympic rings fountain," Newman says.
The park is part of the Olympics' $5 billion economic impact on the city. The games also planted the seeds for new tourist attractions, including the Georgia Aquarium.
A couple of miles north is what once was the Olympic Village, where 10,000 athletes ate and slept. The buildings have been turned into dorms for two universities. Newman says the games brought housing and infrastructure projects that would not have happened as quickly — or perhaps at all.
"It certainly put Atlanta on the map as a place to be taken seriously among cities throughout the world," he says.
Enlarge this image toggle caption AFP/Getty Images AFP/Getty Images
Economic Transformation
The Olympics is at least partly responsible for a huge population increase, from 3.5 million people in 1996 to nearly 5.5 million in the metro area today. But that spectacular growth also has had a downside: increased traffic and a declining housing market.
Property values are way down, and hundreds of condos, apartments and lofts that were built are for sale or vacant. But experts say that's because of the larger recession, not a post-Olympic crash.
"People had very unrealistic expectations of what the Olympics could do," says Ken Bernhardt, a marketing professor at Georgia State University. He says it was not practical to count on a long-term economic boost.
"The impact was big," Bernhardt says. "It was short term with some infrastructure improvements and cleaning up downtown. What reason would anybody have to expect that that expenditure would have a big impact 15 years later?"
Atlanta's unemployment rate is 10.5 percent — much higher than the national average, and a recent study says the region has lost more than 200,000 jobs since 2007. So while an economic transformation is evident in parts of the city, many poor communities were overlooked, says Michael Leo Owens, a political science professor at Emory University.
"We still have tremendous unemployment, and so it's one of the reasons why people have used the phrase that Atlanta is a paradox," Owens says.
'You Can Still See ... A Lot Of Decline'
Just a few blocks from Olympic stadium is Atlanta's Pittsburgh neighborhood. As we drive just off McDaniel Street, LaShawn Hoffman with the Pittsburgh Community Improvement Association says this area was left out of the Olympic prosperity.
"We still have overgrown kudzu. We have some homes that are still vacant and abandoned," Hoffman says. "You can see some new infill construction that has happened, but you can still see that there is a lot of decline."
Out of about 12,000 structures in the neighborhood, Hoffman says half are vacant.
"Again, we were right off the cusp and outside of the view of where the majority of the traffic, the people would be. And so, where we really wanted our neighborhood to be able to benefit from the investment that was being made, the Pittsburgh neighborhood didn't prosper," Hoffman says.
That's the paradox that Michael Leo Owens at Emory University continues to witness.
"We could argue that the place of Atlanta has benefited in all sorts of ways, but we also, I think, would be hard-pressed to say that all the people in that place have actually benefited from the legacy of the Olympic Games," Owens says.
Some economic forecasts show that it will take a couple of years for Atlanta to rebound from the overbuilding it saw before and after the Olympics — and the massive bank failures that followed. The city is now focusing on transportation and redevelopment, intended to help some of the communities that missed out on the Olympic opportunity.

You love to bird and so do we! At the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service we look for opportunities to get people outside and learn about their natural world. More than 250 nature enthusiasts, bird lovers and city neighbors came out for the 2018 International Migratory Bird Day Celebration in May at Labagh Woods in Chicago, Illinois. Take a moment to learn about how Chicago is rallying around birds.
Labagh Woods provides a needed stopover site for birds migrating through the Chicago area to rest and refuel on their journeys north and also provides a place for city residents to renew themselves by connecting with nature. A new species was spotted at the preserves during the event: the site’s first recorded yellow-crowned night heron.
We are proud to collaborate with event host, Forest Preserves of Cook County, to welcome back birds migrating from Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. This year’s event pulled together a wide-ranging partnership of local organizations including: Audubon Great Lakes, Bird Conservation Network, Chicago Audubon Society/Chicago Bird Collision Monitors, Chicago Ornithological Society, Chicago Park District, Friends of the Forest Preserves, Illinois Young Birders, The Field Museum and numerous volunteers.
Children learned about bird migration and conservation through games and hands on activities. Some of the children were able to release birds banded during the event, a special up close encounter with the birds and the scientists working to conserve them.
Visitors to the event learned about the volunteer-led restoration efforts at Labagh, toured the bird-friendly shrubs being planted in restored habitat at the preserve, and went on guided walks to see some of the warblers and waterbirds using the restored habitat.
The event was part of a multi-year initiative by the Forest Preserves of Cook County and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service known as “Bird the Preserves.” This collaboration connects communities with the protected preserves near them by expanding birding programs and activities and bringing new birders to the forest preserves.

Port of Dubuque Marina Received Largest Boating Infrastructure Grant in History
The city of Dubuque celebrated the grand-opening of the Port of Dubuque Marina with a ribbon cutting ceremony on June 1.

On June 1, 2013 the city of Dubuque unveiled its freshly completed Port of Dubuque Marina Project with a public ribbon cutting event. The Port of Dubuque Marina features 70 transient slips for boats of greater than 26 ft. along the shores of the Mississippi River. The ribbon cutting ceremony was also hosted by the National Mississippi River Museum and Aquarium to celebrate the opening of the Museum’s Mississippi Plaza in conjunction with the grand-opening of the marina.
The marina project was supported by the Boating and Infrastructure Grant (BIG) Program of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as well as the city of Dubuque. Dubuque received a BIG grant of $3,037,802 for the project making it the largest grant ever awarded to a public or private entity under the BIG program. The project totaled $4.1 million with the city of Dubuque committing $1,088,950 of local funds to the project.
Each state in the U.S. receives a baseline amount of grant funding from the BIG Program called Tier I funding. In addition to that, private or public entities can apply for additional funding through the BIG Tier II competitive grants. The city of Dubuque submitted an application for the Tier II competitive grant, which they received in 2006 for this project. The project has been in the works since then and was completed in time for the 2013 boating season.
The Port of Dubuque is well stocked with amenities for recreational boaters including water and electrical connections, a fuel dock, sanitary pump-out facilities, and two shore entry/exit locations with ADA-compliant access. In addition, there are dockside shower suites, restrooms, a laundry facility, and a ship store.
The Marina is part of America’s River Project, which was launched through a partnership between the city, the state, and private enterprises. The project aims to create the finest tourism attraction along the Mississippi River. The Port is bordered by Dove Harbor to the north, which is fairly industrial and Ice Harbor to the south, which is home to much of the recreation on the river. The Port of Dubuque Marina will be the gateway to America’s River Project which hosts several major tourism components along the harbor including an aquarium, a resort and waterpark, a brewery, and two casinos, among others.
Dubuque is expecting that the addition of this marina will generate many local, regional, and national benefits, both recreationally and economically. A study conducted by the city found that existing private marinas were not meeting demand for the transient boat community along the Mississippi. In addition, the Iowa Welcome Center in Dubuque had been receiving 20-30 requests each month in the summer for a transient boating facility. The city expects that the development of this marina along America’s River Project will attract visitor markets from the markets of Chicago and Milwaukee, encourage more transient boating opportunities along the river, and strengthen Dubuque’s tourism industry as it is estimated that the marina would be filled 10-12 weeks in the summer.
The BIG Program is managed through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Program. The Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration Program efficiently and effectively administers grant programs and works with fish and wildlife agencies in a mutually responsible, cooperative and creative grant partnership to protect and enhance fish, wildlife, and habitat resources for present and future public benefit.

Inside The Indiana Megadairy Making Coca-Cola's New Milk
Enlarge this image toggle caption Dan Charles/NPR Dan Charles/NPR
Coca-Cola got a lot of attention in November when it announced that it was going into the milk business. Not just any milk, mind you: nutritious, reformulated supermilk.
It also invited ridicule. "It's like they got Frankenstein to lactate," scoffed Stephen Colbert on his show. "If this product doesn't work out, they can always re-introduce Milk Classic."
In fact, the idea for New Milk didn't come from Coca-Cola at all. It emerged from a huge, high-tech dairy farm in Indiana.
That dairy, called Fair Oaks Farms, doubles as America's one and only dairy theme park, a bit of Americana that interrupts a monotonous stretch of Interstate 65 between Chicago and Indianapolis.
It grabs the attention of drivers with a series of tank trucks parked broadside like billboards in fields beside the highway. Painted on the tanks are cryptic messages: "We Dairy You To Exit 220." Then: "We Double Dairy You." The final tank truck has two huge fiberglass cows mounted on top of it.
The pitch may be goofy, but the farm is serious business. It's one of the biggest and most sophisticated dairies in the country, and it is home to 37,000 cows, divided among 11 different milking operations.

The visitors center offers a cheerful picture of milk production. The most startling touch: a small amphitheater where visitors can watch, through a floor-to-ceiling glass wall, as cows give birth.
Then it's off to the working part of the farm aboard a small bus. The bus rolls right down the middle of a barn that's almost 500 yards long, past about 1,000 cows that are eating, standing around, and lying in stalls on beds of sand.
There's also a stop at the "milking parlor," where visitors watch from a balcony as cows, one by one, step onto an enormous rotating turntable to be milked. Sensors identify each cow, and computers record how much milk she's producing.
"Take a look! They're calm, cool and collected, exactly the way the farmers want them to be," says my tour guide, Terry Tracy.
This is the frontier of dairying. In fact, the people who run this place are so ambitious, they're ready to change milk itself.
Coca-Cola is now a partner in this venture, but the idea began years ago, when two of the founders of Fair Oaks, Mike and Sue McCloskey, were running a big dairy operation in New Mexico. They ran into a problem with bad water, and had to buy some expensive membranes to filter out impurities.
Enlarge this image toggle caption Dan Charles/NPR Dan Charles/NPR
Sue McCloskey says they started thinking about what those filters might accomplish with milk: "Is there something else we can do with this milk that will give it a premium value that we're not thinking about?"
They realized that the filters could separate raw milk into its different parts, such as protein, lactose, minerals and water. Perhaps they could put those parts back together in different proportions, altering milk's time-honored recipe.
"I remember sitting down with Mike, and we were talking about this," McCloskey says. "And I told him, 'Listen, if you could make a milk for me, as a woman, where I could get all of my calcium and a bunch of my protein in one glass or serving — holy mackerel, that would be the most awesome thing!' "
They did, in fact, create a kind of milk with extra protein and calcium but no lactose. The H-E-B supermarket chain in Texas sells it as Mootopia. It tastes like a slightly thicker, richer version of milk.
Now the idea is going national, propelled by the immense marketing and logistical muscle of Coca-Cola. The beverage giant has joined forces with Fair Oaks Farms and Select Milk Producers, the cooperative that the McCloskeys founded in 1994. They created a venture called Fairlife to produce a new line of milk-derived beverages. The first product, which is similar to Mootopia, will arrive in the dairy sections of supermarkets in January.

Most official Fourth of July celebrations are canceled. And, you may be feeling cranky after weeks of DIY firework displays scaring your dogs and children. Across the country, the usual gamut of big-tickets events have gone virtual: The National Park Service is offering virtual tours of national monuments, including a 360 visit to the Statue of Liberty and this e-trip to Independence Hall in Philadelphia. (This computer modeled recreation of the Liberty Bell's E flat is actually kind of cool.)
But for Chicagoans who still have the energy, we've compiled a list of ways to celebrate the nation's favorite holiday besides just, you know, sitting at home with your White Claw and sparklers.
Fireworks
Sorry, Navy Pier's annual show is canceled, but the pier itself will be open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at limited capacity.
The thing this year: drive-in fireworks in the parking lots of sports stadiums. At the SeatGeek stadium in Bridgeview watch them at 9:15 p.m on July 3. On July 4, fireworks will go off outside Memorial Stadium in Joliet at dusk. And at the Frontier Sports Complex in Naperville, watch from 9:30 to 10 p.m.
watch them at 9:15 p.m on July 3. On July 4, fireworks will go off outside Memorial Stadium in at dusk. And at the Frontier Sports Complex in watch from 9:30 to 10 p.m. In Orland Park, the suburb's annual 5K on July 3 and fireworks at 9:30 p.m. on July 4 at Centennial Park are still a go but at reduced capacity. Watch for crowds — many nearby suburbs have canceled their celebrations.
The lakefront, Millennium Park and other open spaces
Beaches east of Lake Shore Drive are closed, with red flags signaling that swimming is not allowed and lifeguards are not on duty. Chicago Park District security and the city's social distancing ambassadors will be on duty to wag their fingers at all fun making, including grilling, within closed areas on the lakefront.
Neighborhood parks, the Lakefront Trail, the 606 and downtown hotspots like Maggie Daley and Millennium parks will be open.
Millennium Park's Great Lawn is also open — with social distancing circles newly painted on the grass within which small groups may spread out and lounge.
The Forest Preserves of Cook County will also be open, but parking lots at several popular sports are closed to prevent overcrowding. Cookouts and picnics are prohibited. Public bathrooms are closed. Check the website for updated information.
Direct to your living room
On July 4, Chicago's Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE) is organizing two virtual concerts: one for dance music and another for patriotic oldies. The first, starting at noon, is a live-streamed dance music festival that includes House music performer Byron Stingily, Carla Prather of Poi Dog Pondering and special guest DJ Deon Cole, the comedian and actor well known for his role in the ABC sitcom Black-ish. The second, from 6:30 to 7:30 p.m., is a digital version of the Grant Park Music Festival's usual Fourth of July programming, featuring the Grant Park Orchestra performing bangers like "American Flute Salute," "God Bless America," "America the Beautiful" and the "1812 Overture."
From 5 to 6:30 p.m., also on July 4, DCASE is hosting a virtual live salsa lesson and invites you to form socially distanced dance parties in your home or backyard. More details here.
Evanston is going fully virtual this year. The township is streaming a behind-the-scenes peek at its Fourth of July programming at 11 a.m., followed by a virtual parade at 2 p.m. and fireworks show at 8 p.m.
