3 ways the federal government can honor Hispanic Heritage Month by including irreplaceable cultural sites in the National Park System

From the earliest Spanish explorers to contemporary leaders in civics, the arts and industry, Hispanic heritage is an essential part of the American story. But currently, only a few units in the National Park System specifically preserve and interpret Hispanic history and culture.

In Southern California alone, however, numerous sites of significance to Hispanic heritage exist, and I have been working with colleagues at NPCA to include these parts of our history in our National Park System. NPCA believes our national parks must reflect our country’s diverse people and shared history — and inclusion of these sites is one step toward building a system that reflects the heritage of all Americans.

As we kick off Hispanic Heritage Month, which begins today and runs through October 15, I want to highlight some of these important places that deserve federal protection.

1. The Founding of Los Angeles and the Rim of the Valley

In 1769, Spanish nobleman Gaspar de Portola led the first-recorded European land expedition from Mexico to explore California. Along the way, his expedition camped on the bank of what is now the Los Angeles River, encountered Native American villages in present-day San Fernando Valley and, most importantly, identified the area from which the city of Los Angeles would take root. Several years later, in 1781, an expedition of 11 families would travel from Sonora and Sinaloa, Mexico, to establish El Pueblo de Los Angeles, a 44-acre district which is now preserved as a state historic monument and recognized as the birthplace of the city. The monument preserves such structures as the Avila Adobe, the city’s oldest surviving residence, and the Pico House, one of its earliest hotels.

These sites are all located in the geographic region known as the Rim of the Valley, a 193,000-acre corridor with some of the last wild natural spaces and historic sites in need of protection in the greater Los Angeles region. The National Park Service released a study in 2016 recommending expanding the nearby Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area to include these sites. The agency already operates a district office at El Pueblo de Los Angeles, and could expand outreach, education and engagement programs that reach deep into LA’s urban, underserved and ethnic communities, including Latinos and others not traditionally connected to our national parks. This, in turn, could help diversify park visitation and build a new, diverse generation of park enthusiasts. NPCA strongly supports this expansion.

2. The Legacy of César Chávez and the Farm Worker Movement

In 2012, President Obama designated the César E. Chávez National Monument in Keene, California, as the first national park site to honor a contemporary Latino American. The monument preserves the labor leader’s home and office on a campus (known as Nuestra Señora Reina de la Paz) that now serves as the headquarters for the union he helped establish, the United Farm Workers (UFW). It also interprets the history of immigrant farm workers and their struggle for decent pay, safe working conditions and other basic human rights — a struggle which continues today.

The National Park Service has since examined multiple sites across California and Arizona to capture a more comprehensive history of the farm worker movement in the Southwest. Earlier this year, Congressman Raul Ruiz introduced the César Chávez National Historical Park Act (H.R.4882), which would incorporate several of these sites, along with the current national monument, into a new, expanded park. These sites include:

The Forty Acres National Historic Landmark , Delano, California: The Forty Acres was the first headquarters for the UFW, and the site of Agbayani Village, a retirement complex for Filipino American farm workers, many of whom were instrumental in forming the UFW. The site continues to serve as UFW field office and provides retirement housing for former farm workers.

Filipino Community Hall , Delano, California: A center for farm worker organizing in the Filipino American community, workers went on strike here in 1965, setting off a series of events that led to the forming of the UFW.

McDonnell Hall , San Jose, California: Chávez first developed into a labor leader and civil rights advocate here under the mentorship of two individuals who would have a profound impact on his life, religious leader Father Donald McDonnell and community organizer Fred Ross.

The Santa Rita Center, Phoenix, Arizona: In 1972, Chávez’s 24-day fast at this small brick building galvanized the farm worker movement and brought national attention to its struggle for better wages and working conditions and the right to organize.

Establishing the national historical park will ensure that the story of the farm worker movement continues to inspire future generations. NPCA is working with a wide range of partners to promote the proposed park, including various segments of the Latino community, historic preservationists, labor organizations, conservation groups and others.

Update, September 2017: H.R. 4882 did not pass Congress during the 2016 session, but NPCA is hopeful that the bill will be reintroduced in 2017.

3. Other Sites and Stories in Southern California

The Rim of the Valley and the legacy of César Chávez are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Hispanic heritage in Southern California and beyond. Los Angeles is home to historic neighborhoods such as Boyle Heights. This community is credited with the rise of Latino cultural and political influence and was the home of LA’s first Latino city council member, Edward Roybal. The neighborhood contains numerous historic buildings, shrines and plazas and continues to be a center for Latino cultural life in Los Angeles. Nearby East Los Angeles was the site of key events in Chicano and Mexican American history, particularly during the civil rights and Vietnam War eras. In San Diego, Chicano Park preserves the country’s largest collection of outdoor murals, as well as various sculptures, earthworks and architectural pieces dedicated to the cultural heritage of the community.

The Park Service has been studying the contributions of Latinos in all aspects of American life, from business and labor to media, education and science. A recent theme study by the agency sets the stage for a concerted effort to recognize Hispanic heritage and related historic sites throughout the country. However, diversifying the National Park System to include these sites is a process that will take widespread advocacy and grassroots action.

Although numerous national park sites commemorate aspects of Hispanic culture — including Cabrillo National Monument, Coronado National Memorial, Dry Tortugas National Park, Golden Gate National Recreation Area, San Antonio Missions National Historical Park and San Juan National Historic Site — large gaps in this important history are missing. NPCA hopes that in the future, all Americans will be able to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month through expanded national park sites that recognize the many contributions of Latino Americans across our country.

Here is a story about Pueblo Grande Museum. Pueblo Grande Museum will be coming up in 3.83 miles, and can be found 2.41 miles from the route to the north or left. 'Top 10 Things to Do in Phoenix, Arizona' was and was published on July 01, 2018 in National Geographic. Hope you like it! 

Phoenix’s cool modern identity celebrates the desert and the desert dwellers who made it possible.

Wildlife

Without the Salt and Gila Rivers, the Hohokam couldn’t have built the canal systems necessary to settle the valley more than a thousand years ago. Modern humans and animals are as dependent on the waterways as ever. For some of the best wildlife viewing—from blue herons and bald eagles to javelina and herds of mustangs—paddle the Lower Salt River.

Natural Wonder

For many Phoenix residents, the best part of the city is the surrounding Sonoran Desert, from saguaros with their trademark arms to water-pocked and wind-worn sandstone buttes. To explore this natural wonder head to Papago Park, just minutes from downtown, or South Mountain, one of the largest municipal parks in the United States.

National Park

Just 225 miles from Phoenix, the Colorado River carves through the surrounding plateau. For six million years, the water has sliced geologic time, exposing bands of sandstone, limestone, and shale. The resulting Grand Canyon—one of the world’s Seven Natural Wonders—winds for 227 river miles, at times diving a mile deep, at others gaping as wide as 18 miles.

Archaeological Site

The Pueblo Grande Museum & Archaeological Park, open to the public since 1929, provides a window into the life of the Hohokam people who inhabited the Valley of the Sun until 1375. A trail highlights ruins of a prehistoric ball court and platform mound, re-created dwellings, an interpretive garden, and multimedia and interactive exhibits.

Cultural Experience

On the first and third Fridays of the month, local organization Artlink coordinates art walks and trolley tours of the city’s creative districts. Outside of those days, the historic Roosevelt Row neighborhood is a walkable art hub with murals, galleries, and museums to ogle by day and jazz clubs and themed bars to tuck into after dark.

Off the Beaten Path

For a fresh perspective on the Valley of the Sun, check out the metro area’s many architectural gems, including Frank Lloyd Wright creations and Paolo Soleri’s urban laboratory for consciously designed communities. Get a closer look at the downtown architecture on Phoenix Rising Tours’s seasonal walking, biking, and trolley tours of historic and modern buildings.

Most Iconic Place

Sprawling across 140 acres, the Desert Botanical Garden showcases the stark beauty of Sonoran flora. Trails loop through more than 50,000 plant displays, including wildflower plots and edible gardens. A Phoenix institution since 1939, the DBG supports research and conservation and hosts rotating exhibitions as well as classes and workshops. Daily tours are led by seriously passionate and knowledgeable guides.

Late Night

Phoenix is in the midst of an indie music explosion, and intimate pop, rock, jazz, and country bands are performing in reimagined spaces. Set in a former garage, Crescent Ballroom is a lounge and restaurant with free live music. The city’s newest venue, The Van Buren, was once a historic car dealership.

Historic Site

The Heard Museum introduces visitors to the Native American and Hispanic cultures that have influenced and continue to shape Central Arizona and the Southwestern United States. Founded in 1929, the world-renowned museum reminds us that cultures are alive and history is still being made. Displays include work from contemporary artists, and educational programs and festivals run throughout the year.

The next story is about American Heart Association. American Heart Association will be coming up in 3.11 miles, and can be found 0.56 miles from the route to the west or right. 'Eating Cheese Every Day May Actually Be Good for You' was written by Amanda Macmillan in TIME. Enjoy! 

Cheese is typically considered more of an indulgence than a health food, but a new review of research suggests that it may not be as bad for you as once thought. In fact, people in the analysis who ate a little bit of cheese every day were less likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke, compared to those who rarely or never ate cheese.

Cheese, like other dairy products, contains high levels of saturated fat—which has been linked to high cholesterol, atherosclerosis and an increased risk of heart disease. (Recently, however, some nutrition experts believe that saturated fat is more benign.) But cheese also contains potentially beneficial ingredients like calcium, protein and probiotics, wrote the authors of the new paper, published in the European Journal of Nutrition.

To learn more about how long-term cheese consumption affects a person’s risk for cardiovascular disease, researchers from China and the Netherlands combined and analyzed data from 15 observational studies including more than 200,000 people. All but one of the studies excluded people with existing heart disease, and all but two tracked people for 10 years or more.

MORE: The Case for Eating Cheese is Stronger Than Ever

The researchers’ findings were “certainly different from what people might expect,” says Dr. Allan Stewart, director of aortic surgery at Ichan School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center, who was not involved in the new analysis. Overall, people who consumed high levels of cheese had a 14% lower risk of developing coronary heart disease and were 10% less likely to have a stroke than those who rarely or never ate cheese.

The relationship, however, was U-shaped rather than linear—meaning that higher quantities of cheese were not necessarily better. The people who had the lowest risks for heart disease and stroke were those who consumed, on average, about 40 grams a day—about the size of a matchbook. (According to the review, the average American eats about 42.5 grams a day.)

“This is not the same as eating a big slice of cheesy pizza every day,” says Stewart. He also cautions against reading too much into data that’s self-reported—as much of the data was—because people tend to over- or under-estimate their consumption of specific foods.

Stewart points out that the study was only able to find an association between cheese consumption and decreased risk of heart disease, rather than a cause-and-effect relationship. It could be that people who eat cheese on a daily basis are healthier overall, or have more disposable income and higher socioeconomic statuses.

But it’s also possible that cheese has beneficial qualities that offset the negative impact of its high saturated fat content, says Stewart. “Cheese can be high in probiotics, which tend to put you in less of an inflammatory state,” he says. Cheese also contains conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), an unsaturated fatty acid that may increase the amount of of HDL “good” cholesterol and decrease “bad” LDL levels.

“There is some evidence that cheese—as a substitute for milk, for example—may actually have a protective effect on the heart,” says Stewart. “No one’s saying you should definitely go out and eat 40 grams of cheese a day. But on the upside, a bit of cheese on a cracker doesn’t sound unreasonable.”

The study did not look at different types of cheeses, and Stewart says more research is needed to know whether certain varieties hold more health benefits (or risks) than others. Overall, though, the news is good for cheese lovers.

“We’re always are searching for ways to minimize heart disease and reduce atherosclerosis,” he says. “It’s promising to find that something that actually tastes good—and pairs well with a nice glass of red wine—may offer some protection, as well.”



Here is a story about Mountain View Park. Mountain View Park will be coming up in 6.65 miles, and can be found 2.53 miles from the route to the northeast or left. '11 of America’s Best National Park Beaches' was in National Parks Conservation Association. Safe travels! 

Need some sun and surf in your travel plans? NPCA staff highlight top beach vacation spots at national parks around the country.

1. Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, Michigan

Not all of the best beaches are near the ocean — Lake Michigan is a popular destination for sun worshippers in the Midwest. So popular, in fact, that swimming at both Indiana Dunes and Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshores can be a crowded experience, especially during the height of summer. For a quieter experience at Sleeping Bear, visit the relatively secluded Peterson Road Beach in the southern part of the park or take the ferry to South Manitou Island. The island has beautiful beaches, and the ferry landing offers a few excellent restaurants to refresh you after your journey back to the mainland.

2. Canaveral National Seashore, Florida

For a classic beach vacation with sea and surf — and maybe even a manatee sighting — it’s hard to beat this barrier island half an hour south of Daytona. These wild, undeveloped beaches with large natural sand dunes sit just a few miles north of the high-tech rocket launch pads at nearby Kennedy Space Center and Canaveral Air Force Base on Florida’s “Space Coast.” Canoe or fish in the lagoon, swim the blue waters and hike the area trails. Just get there early during peak season, as the beach — and the parking lot — fill up quickly.

3. Padre Island National Seashore, Texas

This remote Gulf Coast seashore is the longest stretch of undeveloped barrier island on Earth and home to some of the best birding opportunities in the country. With only one vehicle entrance at the north end of the park near Corpus Christi and just a few miles of paved roadway, the park’s untamed shores are largely undisturbed by crowds — aside from the clusters of turtle hatchlings that find safe haven there. Park staff recently celebrated the 40th anniversary of their popular public hatchling release program.

4. Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, Alaska

If your perfect beach vacation involves watching animals in the wilderness while surrounded by dramatic mountain views, consider an expedition to the Land of the Midnight Sun. Bartlett Cove at Glacier Bay is a classic Alaskan beach with humpback whales, harbor seals, otters and a wide variety of seabirds. The cove is a short hike from a nearby spruce and hemlock forest where visitors can see even more wildlife, including bears and moose. Take a guided boat tour of the area or rent your own sea kayak for a daytime paddling adventure or an overnight trip to the nearby Beardslee Islands.

5. Redwood Forest National and State Parks, California

Known best for its namesake old-growth trees, this California park also includes nearly 40 miles of wild Pacific coastline. Gold Bluffs is a wild and secluded 10-mile stretch of beachfront named for the gold dust that miners once sought there. Visitors can camp right on the sand among the dunes and driftwood, enjoying the dramatic cliffs and visits from the local wildlife, including Roosevelt elk. Visitors can also take an easy hike from the beach on a creek bed into Fern Canyon. The narrow, level path winds through 50-foot canyon walls lined with lush mosses and ferns — just pack waterproof shoes for this unforgettable misty walk.

6. Cape Cod National Seashore, Massachusetts

No list of top American beaches is complete without a mention of this windswept New England cape. The park borders a historic fishing village with a thriving artist community and features barrier islands, pine and oak forests, tidal flats, kettle ponds, boardwalks, lighthouses, and 15 beaches for swimming and fishing. It’s a perfect place to indulge in the sand and surf. You can even swim at the same beach where Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi sent the first successful transatlantic wireless radio message!

7. Gulf Islands National Seashore, Florida and Mississippi

The 12 separate units of this park protect a series of barrier islands off the Gulf Coast and offer a little bit of everything, including snorkeling, fishing and bicycling, though the main draw is simply relaxing on the sparkling whitest-of-white sands. Hike the bayous and coastal forests on the Mississippi side and explore several impressive brick forts on the Florida side, including historic Civil War forts and a Spanish colonial structure dating back to 1797.

8. Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, California

At the southernmost tip of the country’s largest urban national park is Point Dume, just a half-hour drive from Los Angeles. Its towering bluffs, rocky coves, white sand beaches and rich kelp beds are not only popular with locals, but also a favorite setting for commercials, music videos, TV shows and movies. Enjoy the panoramic views while you swim or surf, go on a dive with a local outfitter, or visit in the winter months, when you can witness whales migrating through the bay at surprisingly close range.

9. Cape Lookout National Seashore, North Carolina

It takes a bit more planning and effort to visit this park than it does to travel to nearby Cape Hatteras, but if you are looking for remote, wild beaches, it’s worth the trouble. The only way to access these barrier islands is by boat to one of the park’s five ferry landings. Aside from a few historic buildings, including the park’s checkered lighthouse, the beaches are wild and undeveloped, and you’ll have little company, aside from shorebirds, marine animals and the more than 100 wild horses that roam the islands.

10. Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, Wisconsin

Lake Superior is the nation’s largest lake — so large it could fit all four of the other Great Lakes inside of it and still have room for three more Lake Eries. Because of this, its waters are uncomfortably cold, even in summer. Lucky you: This means you can kayak around the park’s 21 islands and have the beaches and spectacular blue waters largely to yourself, far away from the summer crowds. It’s a paradise for visitors who would rather boat, fish, dive and explore the islands’ lighthouses than go for a swim — or for those who don’t mind a shockingly chilly dip.

11. Olympic National Park, Washington

The 73 miles of shoreline at Olympic offer both accessible and remote beach experiences. Drive up to Kalaloch or Rialto Beach for a family-friendly afternoon of sun and surf, or head further north and hike to more remote destinations along the Olympic Wilderness Coast. (Just be sure to carry a map and a tide chart to avoid getting trapped when the tides roll in — if unsure, check with a ranger before heading into the wilderness.) Either way, the sand, cliffs, tide pools and dramatic sea stacks are an enchanting way to experience the Pacific.

It is also found in wetland communities such as desert marshes, playa lakes, bolson depressions (enclosed basins), and on floodplains [18,36,50,51]. In southeastern Arizona big sacaton grassland is common in lowland habitats and on floodplains [4,6,12]. Common associates include vine-mesquite (Panicum obtusum), hairy grama (Bouteloua hirsuta), slender grama (B. filiformis), and sand dropseed (Sporobolus cryptandrus) [6,34,43]. In Arizona and New Mexico big sacaton occurs on lower elevation plateaus and mesas with New Mexico feathergrass (Stipa neomexicana) [46]. In New Mexico a giant dropseed (Sporobolus giganteus)-big sacaton-little bluestem (Schizachyrium scoparium) series has been described [19]. In Texas big sacaton is a prominent species in bottomlands and on creek flats of the Rio Grande [33]. At the mouth of the Rio Grande, a big sacaton series has been described [40]. It forms a mosaic with shrublands in the Texas ebony (Pithecellobium flexicaule)-snake eyes (Phaulothamnus spinescens) series, tidal flats in the glasswort (Salicornia bigelovii/S. virginica)-saltwort (Batis maritima) series and cordgrass (Spartina spp.) marshes. It is also a member of the saltgrass (Distichlis spicata)-Olney threesquare (Scirpus americanus) series [40]. In the Chihuahuan Desert big sacaton grassland communities have been described [25,49,50]. In Arizona a western honey mesquite (Prosopis glandulosa var. torreyana) and big sacaton grassland occurs [49]. Big sacaton is found in bolson depressions surrounded by desert scrub such as honey mesquite; these basins may encircle a saline marsh or playa [50]. Common associates include fourwing saltbush (Atriplex canescens), mound saltbush (A. obovata), tobosa (Hilaria mutica), alkali sacaton (Sporobolus airoides), and seepweed (Suaeda spp.) [25,50]. In north-central Mexico big sacaton is found in stands of prickly-pear (Opuntia spp.) cactus [29]. The following publications list big sacaton as a community dominant or codominant: Habitat relationships of some native perennial grasses in southeastern Arizona [6] Vegetation and community types of the Chihuahuan Desert [25] Desert grassland [36]

MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS SPECIES: Sporobolus wrightii IMPORTANCE TO LIVESTOCK AND WILDLIFE : Big sacaton is a valuable forage species for livestock in arid and semiarid regions. In Arizona new spring growth of big sacaton is readily eaten by livestock [2]. It is grazed throughout the year when preferred grasses or forbs are not available [12,30]. PALATABILITY : NUTRITIONAL VALUE : Big sacaton forage quality is highest in the spring [12]. As plants mature, leaves and stems become coarse and tough [48]. Average percentage of crude protein contained in big sacaton forage harvested from the South Texas Plains near Whitsett from May 1977 to February 1979 was as follows [23]: spring summer fall winter defoliation treatments none 10.1 5.8 6.4 5.4 monthly (spring to fall) 12.3 10.3 12.1 10.9 spring and mid-summer 12.0 9.7 10.9 9.1 spring and early summer 12.3 10.2 10.6 8.9 spring 12.9 7.5 8.6 8.6 spring/late summer/fall 12.1 7.2 10.9 10.0 mid-summer and fall 12.8 6.4 11.5 10.1 COVER VALUE : Big sacaton stands provide cover for wildlife and cattle in summer [6,12]. In Arizona mature stands of big sacaton provide cover for Botteri's sparrow and other passerines, collared peccaries, diamondback rattlesnakes, and many rodents [2,4,53]. Botteri's sparrow reaches maximum breeding densities in big sacaton grasslands [5]. VALUE FOR REHABILITATION OF DISTURBED SITES : NO-ENTRY OTHER USES AND VALUES : NO-ENTRY OTHER MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : Big sacaton grasslands favor wildlife [2]; they are utilized by rodents and birds [2,4]. In the Southwest big sacaton grasslands have been severely degraded by channelization, erosion, and overgrazing [4,55]. They are now present in only 5 percent of their original range [14,17]. In southeastern Arizona big sacaton stands produce large green biomass quantities (1,500-3,200 pounds/acre [1,680-3,580 kg/ha]) in the summer that may slow runoff, enhance infiltration, and trap sediments [12]. Big sacaton is important for impeding erosion in areas where flash floods occur [53]. Forage is present throughout the year, but utilization of big sacaton is limited by dead standing foliage; burning or mowing can remove dead foliage, but may decrease forage production of big sacaton for up to 2 years [12,14]. For maximum big sacaton forage production, Cox and others [12] recommend grazing big sacaton in the spring, not grazing in dry summers, and discontinuing fall grazing. Fall defoliation exposes big sacaton crowns to below freezing temperatures; crown exposure may reduce forage production for up to 4 years [14] or kill plants [12]. Managers have traditionally recommended fall and winter burning or mowing big sacaton grassland [14,17]. In southeastern Arizona Cox [14] studied the effect of burning and mowing on big sacaton forage quantity and quality. Big sacaton plots were mowed to 2-inch (5 cm) stubble height in winter (Feb. 6), summer (July 10), and fall (Oct. 2) in 1980, 1981, and 1982. Big sacaton forage quality improved for 6 weeks after mowing in all seasons [14,23]. Accelerated growth on summer-defoliated plots supported the hypothesis that summer mowing has the least negative impact on big sacaton production. Winter and fall mowing had a detrimental effect on production for three summer growing seasons [14]. In another study in southeastern Arizona, Cox and Morton [17] reported that annual winter (February 27) mowing plus spring-summer grazing improved the availability and quality of big sacaton live biomass. However, mowing had a negative effect on growth early in the spring-summer grazing period [17]. See PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE for information on burning big sacaton grassland.

BOTANICAL AND ECOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS SPECIES: Sporobolus wrightii GENERAL BOTANICAL CHARACTERISTICS : Big sacaton is a native, perennial bunchgrass 3 to 6 feet (0.9-1.8 m) tall [5,14,27,47] that grows in dense clumps up to 3 feet (0.9 m) in diameter [47,48]. Leaves are up to 12 inches (30 cm) long [47,48]. Seedheads are open and 1 to 2 feet (0.3-0.6 m) long [48]. RAUNKIAER LIFE FORM : Hemicryptophyte REGENERATION PROCESSES : Big sacaton reproduces exclusively by seed. It lacks specialized morphological seed dispersal mechanisms. In saline habitats of the Chihuahuan Desert, seed may be dispersed by ducks [24]. Big sacaton seed has low germination and establishment rates under high temperatures such as those found in the desert southwest [38]. Establishment of big sacaton seed increased with a reduction of soil temperature from an average of 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 deg C) to 79 degrees Fahrenheit (26 deg C) [38]. In the laboratory, big sacaton germination was 84 percent under optimum conditions (alternating temperatures of 68-95 degrees Fahrenheit [20-35 deg C] and alternating light and dark periods) [52]. Emergence, average shoot height, average root and shoot weight, and average root length were all less in soils at temperatures of 127 degrees Fahrenheit (53 deg C) than in soils at temperatures of 102 degrees Fahrenheit (39 deg C) [38]. SITE CHARACTERISTICS : Big sacaton grows mainly on low alluvial flats, bottomlands, and arroyos subject to flooding [6,14,23,47,48]. It also occurs in wide floodplains [53]. In southeastern Arizona and southwestern New Mexico big sacaton forms nearly monotypic stands on broad floodplains [4]. It is also found on open, unshaded areas such as rocky slopes, plateaus, and mesas [30,46]. It generally grows on sand, sandy loam, silty clay loam [12,14,36], and saline soils [24,45]. Big sacaton occurs at elevations of 2,000 to 5,000 feet (600-1,500 m) in Arizona and 3,100 to 7,000 feet (930-2,100 m) in New Mexico [30,47]. SUCCESSIONAL STATUS : Big sacaton is shade intolerant [53]. In the early 1900's, the Southwest had extensive stands of big sacaton grassland. Channelization, drought, grazing, and fire suppression have all contributed to the invasion of these grasslands by mesquite (Prosopis spp.) and juniper (Juniperus spp.) [8,28,36,49,55]. SEASONAL DEVELOPMENT : Big sacaton initiates leaf production in both summer and winter; winter leaves form within a protective sheath and expand in early spring [14]. Plants have some green foliage throughout the year [14,23]. Flowering occurs from April to May in California and from July to October in Arizona [32,45].

FIRE ECOLOGY SPECIES: Sporobolus wrightii FIRE ECOLOGY OR ADAPTATIONS : Big sacaton sprouts after top-kill [6,53]. Burning may stimulate leaf production. The ability of big sacaton to recover after fire depends on the extent of root crown removal by fire [14]. The greatest potential for natural fire occurs when lightning strike frequency peaks in early summer [14]. Big sacaton is best adapted to summer fires. Fall and spring burning may have long-term negative effects [56]. FIRE REGIMES : Find fire regime information for the plant communities in which this species may occur by entering the species name in the FEIS home page under "Find Fire Regimes". POSTFIRE REGENERATION STRATEGY : Tussock graminoid

FIRE EFFECTS SPECIES: Sporobolus wrightii IMMEDIATE FIRE EFFECT ON PLANT : Many fires probably top-kill big sacaton. In southeastern Arizona a February 1985 wildfire "consumed" all available big sacaton forage [12]. "Hot" early summer fires may kill big sacaton plants. At the Research Ranch in southeastern Arizona, Bock and Bock [2] studied the impact of fire on an ungrazed sacaton grassland community. Height and percent cover of big sacaton were reduced until postfire year 2 on sites burned in summer or winter [2]. This study was part of an extensive body of research on fire effects in semidesert grassland, oak savanna, and Madrean oak woodlands of southeastern Arizona. See the Research Project Summary of this work for more information on burning conditions, fires, and fire effects on more than 100 species of plants, birds, small mammals, and grasshoppers. DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF FIRE EFFECT : NO-ENTRY PLANT RESPONSE TO FIRE : Big sacaton sprouts after top-kill by fire [53]. Big sacaton may recover to prefire coverage in 2 to 3 years on ungrazed sites [4]. Postfire recovery is influenced by fire severity [2] and season of burning [14]. In southeastern Arizona in 1975 and 1976 three wildfires occurred in an ungrazed big sacaton grassland community [2]. The first two fires occurred in mid-May and mid-June 1975, and the third in February 1976. Permanent study sites were established on the two summer burns and on adjacent unburned (control) areas in August 1975. In February 1976 a wildfire occurred on one of the control sites which then became the winter burn study site. The summer burns occurred during hot, dry weather and were probably more severe than the winter burn [2]. Big sacaton postfire percent cover on the four study sites is listed below; prefire cover was not reported. summer burns winter burn control first year second year first year sacaton 74 35 70 50 In postfire year 1, big sacaton percent cover was less on burned than unburned sites, and less on the summer than winter burns. It was similar to prefire cover in the second year [2]. In southeastern Arizona the impacts of burning on big sacaton forage quality and quantity were studied [14,15]. Plots were burned with a headfire in winter (Feb. 6), summer (July 10), and fall (Oct. 2) 1980, 1981, and 1982. Plots had been lightly grazed for 5 years prior to burning. The time from ignition to total forage consumption by fire was recorded by plot. Fuel moistures and weather conditions were as follows [14]: fine fuel-moisture wind speed air temperature % oven-dry weight mi/hr (km/hr) deg F (deg C) winter 10-30 10 (16) 50-64 (10-18) summer 20-25 8-15 (13-24) 84-86 (29-30) fall 45-55 8-10 (13-16) 66-77 (19-25) Big sacaton green forage at the peak of the summer growing season (Aug. 21) 1,2, and 3 years after treatment was as follows: number of growing seasons after treatment 1 2 3 kg/ha winter 400-735 690-850 595-695 summer 700-865 850-935 1,375-1,590 fall 260-725 575-805 745-890 untreated 1,695-1,900 1,365-1,720 1,650-2,000 Green forage availability for the 3 treatment years was consistently greater on untreated plots than on burned plots. In postfire years 1 and 2, big sacaton green forage was greater on summer than on winter- or fall-burned plots. By postfire year 3 green forage on summer-burned plots was nearly equivalent to that on unburned plots [14]. At postfire year 1, standing crops were 60 percent less on spring- and fall-burned plots. At postfire year 2, live biomass on spring-burned plots was 30 percent less than on control plots. On fall-burned plots, 50 percent of plants failed to produce leaves the following spring. Removing hte standing dead biomass which insulates against cold temperatures may have killed the plants [56]. DISCUSSION AND QUALIFICATION OF PLANT RESPONSE : NO-ENTRY FIRE MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS : Land managers have traditionally recommended burning big sacaton grassland in either fall or winter [7,14]. According to Cox [14], winter and fall burns have a detrimental effect on big sacaton plant production for at least three summer growing seasons [14]. Loss of summer-formed leaves inhibits formation of winter leaves, and root crowns may be damaged by frost. Winter burning may reduce plant litter, making green foliage more available to livestock but reducing the long-term viability of big sacaton plants [17]. In Arizona seed-eating rodents are abundant on burned big sacaton sites. Bock and Bock [2] propose that ideal wildlife habitat would be mosaic of big sacaton stands in various stages of postfire succession.

Scribner’s Lodge

Hunter, New York

This former sixties motor lodge is now a luxe basecamp and sits just a marshmallow’s throw from the popular slopes of Hunter Mountain. Perched on 20 woodsy acres near hip Catskills towns like Woodstock, 38-room Scribner’s Lodge has a pool, vinyasa yoga classes, a killer restaurant where ricotta tartines come topped with bright edible flowers, and a cozy Wes Anderson-style library lounge that could have birthed the hygge movement.

Take one of Scribner’s complimentary hybrid or electric cars for a nearby hike—a waterfall trek to Kaaterskill Falls, a challenging five-mile jaunt up Overlook Mountain, or a 4.5-mile hike to an unexpected vista at Huckleberry Point. Pick up snowshoes in the lobby for a self-guided shuffle along the property’s private 1.5-mile trail or join the lodge’s adventure concierge for a bushwhacking or fly-fishing outing. Unwind with a Burnt Maple Old Fashioned around the terracotta chiminea fireplace and wait for twilight.

From $145/night.

The Lodge

Breaks Interstate Park, Kentucky and Virginia

There is no shortage of adventure, savage beauty, and diverse geological features in “The Grand Canyon of the South.” Granted it’s not as big or as deep as its more celebrated namesake, but the crown jewel of Breaks Interstate Park—a five-mile gorge that plunges 1,650 feet—can be intimately explored on a grander scale, accessed by lush trails, rapids, and ravines lined with pink and white rhododendrons. On the Canyon Rim Zipline, which opened in the fall of 2017, visitors can explore 2,000 feet of line run high above the Russell Fork River Gorge.

Spread out over 4,600 acres along the Virginia-Kentucky border, Breaks has a dizzying roster of activities: there’s a new rock-climbing park, 25 miles of hiking trails, 12 miles of moderate to difficult mountain-biking terrain, boating on Laurel Lake, horseback rides and elk tours, and world-class rapids on the Russell Fork (one fierce 75-foot section of the river named “El Horrendo” is considered one of the most difficult to paddle in the East).

After the adventures, enjoy a peaceful night’s sleep at the park’s quaint 81-room lodge, which offers no-frills accommodations near stunning lookouts at Clinchfield, Tower, and Lover’s Leap.

From $64.95/night.

Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park is most famous for its Giant Forest, where visitors can walk among the world’s largest trees on the two-mile Congress Trail, but it’s worth booking a room at Wuksachi Lodge to discover the many wild delights high above and below the Sierra Nevada range.

Built at 7,050 feet in the heart of the park, the modern stone-and-cedar chalet is neighbored by sequoias and majestic mountains. After a locally sourced buffet breakfast at Peaks Restaurant, follow hiking trails from the lodge to places like Cahoon Meadow and Mount Silliman, where you’ll pass blue-green lakes, a steep scramble of granite slabs, and sweeping views of the Central Valley. Farther afield, visitors can find General Sherman, the world’s largest living tree (and largest living organism on the planet), and trek 14,494-foot Mount Whitney, the tallest mountain in the continental U.S. There are enough stunning sites near the lodge itself to consume a weekend though. Duck underground between the ornate marble pillars of Crystal Cave, have a picnic at 75-foot Grizzly Falls, and end the day with a 400-step climb to Moro Rock, overlooking the Giant Forest, 12,000-foot peaks, and a brilliant starry sky.

From $137/night.

National parks offer some of the darkest skies in the country.

If you have trouble seeing the stars from where you live, you’re not alone. Urban areas have become so bright that more than 80 percent of the U.S. population can no longer see the Milky Way from their front door. The National Park Service has its own Night Sky Team to help protect this diminishing resource.

Find a spot to enjoy the Perseid meteor shower next week, or a plan an awe-inspiring trip during the darker months for a glimpse of how the heavens looked before the dawn of electric light.

1. Natural Bridges National Monument, Utah

In 2007, the International Dark-Sky Association named Natural Bridges the first international dark-sky park in the world. This prestigious distinction recognizes the park’s world-class stargazing opportunities as well as its commitment to preserving the darkness through educational programs and responsible outdoor lighting. Enjoy spectacular night skies through the monument’s sandstone arches and rock formations—in some places, visitors may see up to 15,000 stars in a single night. Astronomy programs are presented at the visitor center on Wednesday and Thursday nights through October.

2. Death Valley National Park, California

The astonishing dark sky and stark desert landscape make Death Valley an ideal place to look for meteors. According to the International Dark-Sky Association, the level of light pollution is so low, it “offers views close to what could be seen before the rise of cities.” On October 17 and 18, the Las Vegas Astronomical Society presents its fall stargazing program.

3. Chaco Culture National Historical Park, New Mexico

More than 99% of Chaco Culture is a “natural darkness zone” with no permanent outdoor lighting. It is also the only* site in the National Park System with its own observatory, offering deep-space viewing and a digital imaging system that lets visitors see nebulas, supernovas, and distant galaxies. Frequent ranger-led night sky programs include background on the ways early native culture connected with the night skies. On September 22, during the autumn equinox, join park staff at sunrise in Casa Rinconada to observe the alignment of the building with the equinox sunrise.

*Update: Great Basin National Park opened its own observatory in September 2016. These are now the only two parks in the system with deep-space viewing facilities.

4. Acadia National Park, Maine

The East Coast, with its bright lights and big cities, offers few truly good places to see the night sky. Acadia is a notable exception. Surrounded by ocean, this 47,000-acre park has one of the largest expanses of naturally dark sky east of the Mississippi. Enjoy one of the regular ranger programs on the night skies as stars emerge over Sand Beach, or visit on September 25-29 when the park hosts the Astronomical League’s 6th Annual Night Festival in Bar Harbor.

5. Great Basin National Park, Nevada

Great Basin’s high elevation and arid climate offer excellent opportunities to see the stars, with nearly 360-degree views of the horizon. The Milky Way seems to rise from the park’s highest point, Wheeler Peak. Weekly astronomy programs by the park’s “dark rangers” pair educational talks with telescope observation. The park also offers a Perseid meteor shower watching party in mid-August, as well as a three-day astronomy festival September 18 through 20 with special astronomy-themed events including daytime activities for children and adults.

6. Badlands National Park, South Dakota

On any given night, visitors to Badlands may see up to 7,500 stars and a particularly clear view of the Milky Way galaxy. Astronomy programs with park-provided telescopes in the Cedar Pass area also offer the chance to see planets, nebulae, and other wonders, all set against the stunning buttes, pinnacles, and spires of this landmark park. Night-sky viewing is offered at the Cedar Pass Campground Amphitheater Friday through Monday nights in the summer.

7. Big Bend National Park, Texas

Big Bend’s remote location, low humidity, and infrequent clouds add up to superior night-sky viewing. This international dark-sky park is one of the places least affected by light pollution in the continental United States. On a clear night, visitors can even see the Andromeda galaxy, 2 million light years away. Winter, the park’s least humid season, is the best time to see Big Bend’s night skies.

8. Denali National Park, Alaska

Denali’s wild and remote location offers excellent stargazing—during times of year when the midnight sun isn’t shining. Its latitude also gives it a special claim to fame: the chance to see the aurora borealis. Although the northern lights occur year-round, these fantastic light displays are only visible during the colder, darker times of year. The phenomenon is also famously difficult to predict, but planning a visit from late fall to early spring during the new moon could help your chances. Though you might not have to wait that long—by the second week of August, between midnight and two in the morning, the night sky is dark enough to potentially allow views of the aurora.

9. Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah

The fairy-like silhouettes of Bryce Canyon’s famed hoodoos frame thousands of stars in one of the darkest night skies in the country. This park is one of the most popular places to stargaze in the National Park System, and its staff offers several night-sky programs a week for most of the year, including regular presentations by guest astronomers on a range of topics and more than 50 telescopes for visitors to use. Star programs are offered every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday night beginning at 8:30 p.m. in August and 8 p.m. in September.

10. Grand Canyon-Parashant National Monument, Arizona

This national monument just west of Grand Canyon National Park was recently named an International Dark Sky Province for the “flawless night skies” over its million-plus acres of isolated wilderness. Its unique views of the darkness should only be explored by those comfortable with its remote location and experienced in wilderness survival and safety.

The next story is about Casa Grande Military Reservoir. Casa Grande Military Reservoir will be coming up in 2.65 miles, and can be found 1.81 miles from the route to the west or right. 'The Last Drop' was and was published on April 01, 2010 in National Geographic. Please enjoy this Region Radio story! 

This story appears in the April 2010 issue of National Geographic magazine.

Living in the high desert of northern New Mexico, Louise Pape bathes three times a week, military style: wet body, turn off water, soap up, rinse, get out. She reuses her drinking cup for days without washing it, and she saves her dishwater for plants and unheated shower water to flush the toilet. While most Americans use around a hundred gallons of water a day, Pape uses just about ten.

"I conserve water because I feel the planet is dying, and I don't want to be part of the problem," she says.

You don't have to be as committed an environmentalist as Pape, who edits a climate-change news service, to realize that the days of cheap and abundant water are drawing to an end. But the planet is a long way from dying of thirst. "It's inevitable that we'll solve our water problems," says Peter Gleick, president of the Pacific Institute, a nonpartisan environmental think tank. "The trick is how much pain we can avoid on that path to where we want to be."

As Gleick sees it, we've got two ways to go forward. Hard-path solutions focus almost exclusively on ways to develop new supplies of water, such as supersize dams, aqueducts, and pipelines that deliver water over huge distances. Gleick leans toward the soft path: a comprehensive approach that includes conservation and efficiency, community-scale infrastructure, protection of aquatic ecosystems, management at the level of watersheds instead of political boundaries, and smart economics.

Until the mid-1980s, the city of Albuquerque, some 60 miles southwest of Pape's home in Santa Fe, was blissfully unaware that it needed to follow any path at all. Hydrogeologists believed the city sat atop an underground reservoir "as big as Lake Superior," says Katherine Yuhas, conservation director of the Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority. The culture was geared toward greenery: Realtors attracted potential home buyers from moist regions with landscaping as verdant as Vermont; building codes required lawns. But then studies revealed startling news: Albuquerque's aquifer was nowhere near the size it once appeared to be and was being pumped out faster than rainfall and snowmelt could replenish it.

Duly alarmed, the city shifted into high gear. It revised its water-use codes, paid homeowners to take classes on reducing outdoor watering, and offered rebates to anyone who installed low-flow fixtures or a drip-irrigation system or removed a lawn. Today Albuquerque is a striving example of soft-path parsimony. Across the sprawling city, a growing number of residents and building owners funnel rainwater into barrels and underground cisterns. Almost everyone in town uses low-flow toilets and showerheads.

These efforts have shrunk Albuquerque's domestic per capita water use from 140 gallons a day to around 80. The city "anticipates another 50 years of water, economically and sustainably supplied, even with a growing population," says Yuhas. After that there's the option to desalinate brackish water nearby and new technologies such as dual plumbing: one set of pipes to deliver highly treated potable water and another to recycle less treated water for flushing toilets, watering lawns, and other nonpotable uses. Albuquerque already uses wastewater—from treatment plants and from industry—to irrigate golf courses and parks. Other municipalities have gone a step further and collect wastewater—yes, from toilets—filter and disinfect it to the nth degree, then pump it back into the local aquifer for drinking. There are similar schemes worldwide: Beijing reportedly aims to reuse 100 percent of its wastewater by 2013.

Industry, too, is adapting to less certain water supplies. Frito-Lay will soon recycle almost all its water at its plant in Casa Grande, Arizona; Gatorade and Coca-Cola remove the dust and carton lint from beverage containers using air instead of water; and Google recycles its own water to cool its giant data centers.

This is all reassuring—until you remember that irrigated agriculture accounts for 70 percent of the fresh water used by humans. Given this outsize proportion, it seems obvious that farmers have the greatest potential to conserve water.

Standing on the banks of a trickling ditch, Don Bustos—sunbaked and thickly bearded—demonstrates how he irrigates 130,000 dollars' worth of produce on 3.5 acres north of Santa Fe. "I lift this board"—he points to a plank that forms a gate in the ditch—"and I shove in a stick to hold it up." Gravity does the rest.

For 400 years farmers in the arid Southwest have relied on such acequias—networks of community-operated ditches—to irrigate their crops. The acequia diverts water from a main stream, then further apportions the flow through sluiceways into smaller streams and onto fields. "Without the acequia, there would be no farm," Bustos says. He's also built a water tank with drip-irrigation hoses that feed some of the acequia water directly to the plant roots—and cut his water use by two-thirds as a consequence.

Elsewhere, forward-thinking farmers have replaced flood irrigation with micro-sprinkler systems, laser leveled their fields, and installed soil-moisture monitors to better time irrigation. In California, says the Pacific Institute, such improvements could potentially conserve roughly five million acre-feet of water a year, enough to meet the household needs of 37 million people. Unfortunately, most farmers lack the incentive to install efficient but expensive irrigation systems: Government subsidies keep farm water cheap. But experts agree that more realistic water pricing and improved water management will significantly cut agricultural water use. One way or another, the developed world will get the water it needs, if not the water it wants. We can find new supplies—by desalinating water, recycling water, capturing and filtering storm water from paved surfaces, and redistributing water rights among agriculture, industry, and cities. Cheaply and quickly we can slash demand—with conservation and efficiency measures, with higher rates for water wasters, and with better management policies.

What about the rest of the world? In places lacerated by poverty, the problem is often a lack of infrastructure—wells, pipes, pollution controls, and systems for disinfecting water. Though politically challenging to execute, the solutions are fairly straightforward: investment in appropriately scaled technology, better governance, community involvement, proper water pricing, and training water users to maintain their systems. In regions facing scarcity because of overpumped aquifers, better management and efficiency will stretch the last drops. Farmers in southern India, for example, save fuel in addition to water when they switch from flood to drip irrigation; other communities landscape their hillsides to retain rainwater and replenish aquifers.

Still, the time is coming when some farmers—the largest water users and the lowest ratepayers—may find themselves rethinking what, or if, they should plant in the first place. In the parched Murray-Darling Basin of Australia, farmers are already packing up and moving out.

Now it's time for a story about Santa Cruz River. Santa Cruz River will be coming up in 53.55 miles, and can be found 2.36 miles from the route to the west or right. 'Border Wall Threatens Native American Sovereignty' was and was published on August 15, 2017 in Sierra Club Home Page. Enough introduction, here's the story! 

How do you draw a single borderline through three separate, overlapping nations? While that might sound like a Zen koan—the geopolitical version of the sound of one hand clapping—it’s the actual predicament facing the Tohono O’odham Nation, a Native American tribe whose territory includes both the United States and Mexico. The tribe’s members are infuriated by the prospect of a border wall further dividing their ancestral lands.

Tohono O’odham means “desert people.” The nation historically stretched from the Sonoran Desert southeast of Tucson, Arizona as far south as the Sea of Cortez, which today is the Mexican state of Sonora. There are about 34,000 members of the tribe, most of them living in the United States, and an estimated 2,000 Tohono O’odham living in Mexico. Traditionally, Tohono O’odham would routinely move back and forth across the U.S.-Mexico boundary, often for cultural events at the tribe’s religious sites scattered across the desert. The border militarization of the past 20 years has restricted tribal members’ movements, and today there is just a single authorized border crossing on the reservation. Large sections of the Tohono O’odham territory are bisected by what the U.S. Border Patrol calls “Normandy barriers”—criss-crossed steel bars that can block vehicles from making an illegal border crossing. Tohono O’odham members are concerned that President Donald Trump’s border wall, if constructed, would create new problems for the tribe, as well as for the ecosystem they call home.

“We have so many concerns regarding the wall,” tribal chairman Edward Manuel told me in an interview last spring. “If they are looking at a 30-foot-high fortified wall, that is going to cut our traditional lands in half. The wall would interfere with our way of life, our ceremonies, with our traditional and our cultural activities that we do on both sides of the border, because we still have communities on the Mexican side.”

Manuel said that further border tightening would make it difficult for tribal members in the United States to “do religious pilgrimages into Mexico” and, similarly, for Mexican tribal members to reach Baboquivari Peak, the Tohono O’odham’s most sacred site, located north of the border. Family gatherings also could be interrupted. For example, Tohono O’odham members who were born in Mexico and now live in the United States often want to be buried at their birthplace, and border militarization makes that difficult. The wall, Manuel said, “will have a direct effect on our members.”

Chairman Manuel and other Tohono O’odham leaders also express concerns about the environmental impacts of border militarization. A solid wall could “impede the migration of animals,” Manuel said, “and will unbalance the ecology in the region.” Manuel also pointed to an issue often overlooked in debates over the border wall: the way in which impassable barriers could disrupt the sensitive hydrology of the desert.

The desert is normally arid, but it’s also punctuated by bouts of rain—winter storms and the region’s signature summer monsoons that can drop several inches of water in the space of an afternoon. If border walls were to be built across normally dry arroyos that can turn into raging rivers during a flash flood, the barriers would act as de facto dams that would either shift water courses unpredictably or damage the wall itself.

This has already occurred in the Santa Cruz River watershed around the twin cities of Nogales Arizona, and Sonora, where bollard-style fences stretch about 20 miles to the east and west of the bi-national metropolis. The Santa Cruz River starts in the United States and flows south into Mexico, then makes a U-turn and flows back north into the U.S. and toward Tucson, a kind of hydrological horseshoe. In 2015, storm-related flooding knocked out a 60-foot section of steel border fencing. It cost more than $700,000 to repair. At one of the Santa Cruz River’s border crossings, east of the city of Nogales, the 20-foot-high bollard fence gives way to Normandy barriers in the riverbed. But even those get clogged with debris, threatening the health of the riparian zone. When I visited the site with a couple of activists from a group called Friends of the Santa Cruz River last March, the steel jacks were piled high with flotsam, even though the monsoon season was months away.

“What are they thinking, that they’re going to stop the water flows?” Sheri Sass, a member of Friends of the Santa Cruz River, told me as a Border Patrol SUV rolled past. “Are they going to create dams at the drainages? And if not, then people will just cross the drainages. How could someone even imagine that this is a good idea? It’s just stupid.”

In February, the Tohono O’odham Legislative Council passed a resolution stating that “…while the Nation coordinates closely with [the Border Patrol] and ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] and has supported the construction of vehicle barriers, the Nation opposes the construction of a wall on its southern boundary with Mexico.” Within weeks of that vote, the Inter Tribal Association of Arizona passed a similar resolution against the wall, as did the National Congress of American Indians, which said it opposes “the construction of a physical wall on the southern border of the United States on tribal lands without the consent of affected tribes.”

For now, the Tohono O’odham are withholding that consent and biding their time. Manuel said that officials from the Department of Homeland Security and the Interior Department’s Bureau of Indian Affairs have told tribal leaders that “nothing will happen in a two-year time frame.” In the meantime, the tribe has consented to the construction of at least eight new remote surveillance towers on their territory that could serve as a kind of “virtual wall”—helping to apprehend illegal border crosses without further impacting Tohono O’odham travel or the desert landscape. “They said that if anything is going to happen here, they will sit down and do a consultation with us,” Manuel said.

Tribal leaders have met with officials from the Department of Homeland Security and the Interior Department, and they are in contact with members of Congress, who, experts on Indian law say, would have to approve any seizure of the nation’s territory for border wall construction. The Tohono O’odham leadership also have invited federal officials to their nation to see the border for themselves. They’ve even extended that invitation to the wall’s biggest backer, Donald Trump. “We want them to come and take a look at the area, especially the president,” Manuel said.

So far, the White House hasn’t accepted the offer.

The next story is about Red Rock Community Park. Red Rock Community Park will be coming up in 15.28 miles, and can be found 0.55 miles from the route to the southwest or right. 'Red Rocks' was written by About The Author, Heidi Ridgley, Heidi Ridgley Writes About History, Travel, Wildlife Conservation Washington, and Read More Heidi Ridgley in National Parks Conservation Association. Here we go! 

It’s not hard. Cairns—small rock piles—mark the way, and the wind is company enough. Then I reach a sign that points to what looks like an impossible pass over a red rock wall to the next canyon. “No way,” I mutter to no one.

Suddenly, clambering around by myself in Canyonlands National Park, one of the most remote and rugged parks in the system, doesn’t feel like such a good idea.

Part of the grand Colorado Plateau and the largest of the five national parks in Utah, Canyonlands is a land beyond hyperbole, a place where “Wow!” doesn’t come close to summing up the scenery. Think: supreme, vast, massive, lofty, sublime, pristine, extreme, phenomenal, mystical, and stunning. Here, the Green River meets the legendary Colorado, where they combine to form Class V rapids, the best—or some would say worst—world-class whitewater around, in the tumultuous Cataract Canyon. In the park’s 527 square miles, the adrenaline junkie meets the untrammeled wilderness lover.

TRAVEL ESSENTIALS Canyonlands is open year-round, but the best times to visit are spring and fall, when the daytime temperatures are below 80°F and the nights don’t dip below 0°. Paved roads inside the park are few, but a passenger car is sufficient to reach many of the trailheads for day hikes and some overnight backcountry trips. If mountain biking is your bag, snake down the rough-and-tumble, 100-mile White Rim Road. Primitive campsites along the way allow for multiday journeys, but consider hiring an outfitter to carry water and camping gear. National Park Service authorization is needed to operate in Canyonlands, and NAVTEC’s 4x4s are the only vehicles that provide access to remote trailheads and backcountry camps. This company, along with other outfitters, offers rafting, boating, camping, and cycling adventures from a half-day to multiple days. For a complete list of outfitters, visit the park’s website. For day trips into the Island in the Sky, Moab is close enough to serve as home base. For the Needles—some two hours from Moab—camping is the best option. For the Maze, backcountry camping is the only option—and best with a well-equipped guide. The park’s communal campsites are first-come, first-served and fill up early in the morning. If you can’t get there early, look into campsites run by the Bureau of Land Management or stay in gateway towns like Moab or Monticello. Check the visitor centers for times and locations of ranger presentations on geology at Grand View point in the Island in the Sky. At Horseshoe Canyon, a ranger-guided tour leaves from the trailhead on weekends at 9 a.m. from April through October. A word of warning: Less visited trails may not be adequately marked and maintained. Best to carry—and know how to use—a topographic map. For well-marked trails, the park maps of each section offered at the visitor centers will suffice.

Canyonlands—a place where only American Indians, cowboys, river explorers, and uranium prospectors dared to tread before Congress declared it a park in 1964—is divided into three sections. To reach all three distinct land parcels, visitors must exit the park and travel a couple of hours. The Island in the Sky is a high-altitude desert mesa wedged between the two rivers with 100-mile panoramic views that rival those of any other place on the planet. The Maze, a labyrinth of sandstone, makes even the most experienced backcountry hiker wary. It’s one of the nation’s most remote areas. Lastly, the Needles, named for its distinctive sandstone spires, is truly a hiker’s paradise, with more than 60 miles of interconnecting trails, few paved roads, and whimsical, otherworldly monoliths in almost every direction. After three days in this section alone, I left wishing I had more time.

On my first day in the park, Island in the Sky’s massive 6,000-foot-high cliffs made me feel insignificant as I stood on the edge overlooking an ancient coastline. This showcase of geology began about 300 million years ago, with sediment deposited from the ancestral Rockies and even the Appalachians. Today’s desert expanses were once shallow seas that advanced and retreated, leaving behind sand, salt, and marine limestone that eroded into needles, fins, and arches that make the scenery on any hike worth a few blisters.

I headed to Murphy Point just as the sun’s rays began illuminating the park’s exotic silhouettes. The two-hour route overlooked the vast basins below the mesa top. Without spotting a soul, I felt like the last person on Earth. But that solitude set me up for a little disappointment when I ran into a couple on the White Rim Overlook lingering in “my” perfect picnic spot. Still, there was plenty of space to ferret out another site with a view nearly as perfect.

I closed the day on the Grand View Trail, which looks out over much of the park, including the river canyons, the pinnacles, and the distant La Sal and Henry Mountains. The easy, 1.5-mile level trail was the most crowded in the park, but I timed it so I finished at sunset and had the whole place to myself. The windless night made the silence so powerful I could almost hear it.

Peering down into the canyon all day from afar made me feel like I was floating over the landscape, and I craved a trip into the canyon. So the next day, I jumped in a four-wheel-drive truck with Matt Bigler, a guide with NAVTEC Expeditions based in Moab, to travel down unpaved switchbacks with sheer drop-offs on the Shafer Trail Road. After a 1,200-foot vertical descent, we connected with the White Rim Road, once used by miners. It winds down to Musselman Arch, a walkable natural stone bridge, and Thelma and Louise Point, the scene of the 1991 movie’s car-plunge finale. Before that, Bigler told me, it was called Fossil Point.

The highlight for me, however, was the five bighorn sheep we spotted from above. Only about 4 percent of the bighorns’ historical population remains—with a few hundred staking claim to these rocky ledges. This makes the park crucial to the species’ future. Other inhabitants that mostly go unseen in corners rarely touched by humans are black bears, bobcats, and mountain lions. I kept my eyes peeled, but never did see any prints in the sand.

The next day, in Horseshoe Canyon, the seven-mile round-trip hike took me to some of North America’s most significant Indian rock art. Part of the Maze, Horseshoe Canyon sits disconnected to the northwest, and it’s about a two-and-a-half hour drive from Moab. (Primitive camping is allowed on Bureau of Land Management sites near the trailhead, but if you don’t camp, allow for an entire day.)

SIDE TRIP: NEWSPAPER ROCK Just 150 feet off Highway 211 on the way to the Needles District in Canyonlands National Park lies Newspaper Rock, a profusion of petroglyphs left by prehistoric peoples from 2,000 years ago. The Anasazi, Fremont, Navajo, and Paiute etched these human, animal, and abstract images into the desert varnish on the smooth sandstone. Magnesium oxide caused the dark coating and helps the drawings stand out clearly against the rock face. The prehistoric rock art is some of the most interesting and fanciful you’ll find. And you can drive right up to it. Stop for a brief moment or sit a spell to ponder the message behind the symbols. A short nature trail also points out the desert vegetation.

The 750-foot descent on slickrock to the secluded canyon bottom felt easy, although I knew I’d be huffing and puffing in the blazing sun on the climb back up. I didn’t think too much about it, though, because I was immediately captivated by the foot-long, three-toed dinosaur track about a half-mile in.

The loose sand at the bottom makes hiking a little difficult, but reasons to rest abound: oases of mature cottonwood, an intermittent stream brimming with tadpoles, and pockets of quicksand to muck around in. For most of the 7.5-mile roundtrip, though, I gawked at the vivid red, sheer sandstone erupting into the cerulean blue sky.

Of the four major rock-art sites in the canyon, the Great Gallery is often labeled the world’s best; it includes pictographs and petroglyphs of life-size, mummy-like figures that lack arms and legs, painted and etched 2,000 to 8,000 years ago by prehistoric peoples. Before heading back, I contemplated the artwork for at least an hour with the help of a well-versed volunteer who pointed out details I would have missed.

After Horseshoe Canyon, I decided to spend the next day on some shorter hikes in the Needles. Even though it’s known for its longer treks, the Needles District has a few excellent hikes off the short six-mile paved road. Pothole Point is a fascinating mesa of depressions that collect rainwater and trap windblown sand grains and pebbles. Unfortunately, I visited a little too early in the season so I missed seeing the tiny creatures—fairy shrimp, beetle larvae, and snails—that spend their entire lives in the murky puddles. (Don’t touch, though! Oils, lotions, and sunscreen pollute the waters and harm the inhabitants.)

From there I headed to nearby Slickrock Trail, which leads to a series of four overlooks and includes a panoramic view of much of southeastern Utah and an overlook of Big Spring Canyon. This is the canyon that befuddles me on my fifth and final day when I lack the confidence to cross the canyon wall in front of me.

Even though the Park Service has carved notches in the rock to help hikers with their footing, at 5’1”, I’m too short to reach them easily. Disheartened, I turn back. But then I tell my quivering legs that it really doesn’t look that bad. Walking back on a slickrock slant to the crossing, I stretch my hand to one of the shallow holes, positioning myself so one foot might follow. But again I talk myself out of it and sit down, totally bummed.

That’s when I hear voices and soon see two specks rounding a giant rock toadstool on the path I came up on. I gesture toward the canyon wall and call down: “I chickened out, but now that you can hear me if I scream, I’m giving it shot.”

As quickly as I can—to avoid thinking—I pull myself up on the rock, stick a knee in a notch, flatten my body, and reach out my arms like a tree frog suctioned to the side of an aquarium. When I make it over I stand slackjawed—the scene is even more spectacular on the other side. It makes me almost forget to call out a thank you. The “You’re welcome!” rings out loud and clear.

Now it's time for a story about Rattlesnake Pass. Rattlesnake Pass will be coming up in 20.05 miles, and can be found 1.70 miles from the route to the southwest or right. '13 Unlucky Animals That Are Killed for Fun' was and was published on June 21, 2018 in Sierra Club Home Page. Safe travels! 

Every year, thousands of animals are killed for fun (and often, cash prizes) in wildlife killing contests. Participants at these events are given free rein to kill as many animals as possible of a single species in a fixed period of time—or, as is the case in many “varmint” killing contests, several species. These events are legal throughout most of the United States, and sometimes held on public lands. In some places, state wildlife agencies even support wildlife killing contests under the guise of managing species, although this contradicts the latest science.

“They don’t serve any wildlife management objective other than just going out and killing,” says Jill Fritz, director of wildlife protection at the Humane Society of the United States. Fritz emphasizes that there is a clear difference between killing contests and ethical sporthunting, which follows principles like fair chase and using what you kill. The animals targeted in killing contests are mostly classified as nongame species. That means they can be killed in unchecked numbers, using almost any method imaginable. Participants in killing contests often utilize unsporting practices such as using predator-calling devices that imitate the sound of a distressed animal in order to lure targets out in the open for an easy shot. (The companies that make such devices often serve as corporate sponsors for the killing contests.) Whereas hunters are required to have permits and report the number of animals they kill, wildlife killing contests are largely unregulated.

“Killing contests are symptomatic of a bigger problem,” says Camilla Fox, executive director of Project Coyote. “State agencies are supposed to be the stewards of our wildlife. Wildlife is held in the public trust for all Americans, and yet we have this complete abuse.”

Legislators in some states have begun passing laws to stop such practices. California became the first state to ban prizes for wildlife killing contests in 2014, and Colorado soon followed suit with its own restrictions on prizes and take for small game. As wildlife advocates and online commenters increasingly protest publicly organized killing contests in states without such protections, enthusiasts increasingly organize themselves through private social media groups and word-of-mouth to avoid scrutiny (though publications like Varminter online magazine still exist for unabashed enthusiasts).

“The people that hold these contests know that it looks bad, so they go to great lengths to hide this from the general public,” says Michael Kobliska, vice president of Showing Animals Respect & Kindness (SHARK), an organization that documents events involving animal cruelty. “Seeing animals thrown away like trash is a very offensive image to a lot of people. It’s slaughter for the sake of slaughter.”

Here is a list of 13 unlucky animals that are still killed in wildlife killing contests across the country.

Coyotes

Coyote killing contests are likely the most pervasive sort of animal roundups. At least 42 states have year-round open seasons on coyotes, and since they are not a protected species, they can be killed in unlimited quantities. Couple this with a nasty reputation inherited from ranchers—who fear coyote attacks on livestock—and a little bad blood can turn into a bloodbath. While many other killing contests are organized through underground Facebook groups and word-of-mouth, coyote contests are often advertised openly online on sites like Coyote Contest and Call-In the Country. Some states—Georgia, South Carolina, and Utah are examples—even have state-sanctioned coyote bounties under the guise of “predator control.” There is some good news, though: Vermont recently banned coyote killing contests, and some legislators in New Mexico have sought to do the same.

Foxes

In western New York, there’s a whole event—the annual Hunting WNY Fox Bowl—dedicated to killing foxes. More often, though, foxes are lumped in with coyotes in sweeping “varmint” killing contests. Foxes are sometimes considered inferior catches because they are smaller, which often means that they are killed in greater quantities to accumulate more numbers or weight for the final tallies. The results are not only gruesome but also ecologically damaging. Removing carnivores from ecosystems in such quantities can lead to a “catastrophic cascade effect within that ecosystem and can reduce biodiversity and ultimately reduce the health and vitality of that area,” says Fox from Project Coyote.

Bobcats

Bobcats are considered the cream of the crop in many predator hunting competitions. Among the piles of dead coyotes and foxes at such events, the occasional bobcat is thrown into the mix, often earning a higher point value. In 2015, Mother Jones reported on the West Texas Big Bobcat Contest, where the team that brings in the heaviest bobcat wins the grand prize (teams must also kill either five gray foxes or five coyotes—no mixing of the two—to qualify for the grand prize). That year, $76,000 in prize money was at stake; a team that bagged a 32-pound bobcat went home with more than $31,000.

Wolves

When European settlers colonized North America, they saw large carnivores as a threat to civilization as colonists began hunting species for game and expanding agriculture. These fears manifested in laws that were enacted to extirpate predators from the continent, like a 1630 Massachusetts Bay Colony law that put a bounty on dead wolves. Today, a fear of wolves lives on. When wolves were delisted as endangered species in certain portions of their range, the management of their populations was transferred to the states, many of which opened trophy hunting and trapping seasons on the species; such bounties on wolves often include pup carcasses. Meanwhile, wolves are often added to the list of targets for other predator killing contests (though not always successfully). In 2017, the Bureau of Land Management settled a lawsuit with environmental groups in Idaho requiring the agency to inform the public whenever the agency receives an application for a predator killing contest. But the group Idaho for Wildlife, which hosted the killing contest that started the lawsuit, saw the decision as a win; the group’s executive director said that even though the contest had been put on hold for years after participants weren’t able to successfully kill any wolves, they hope to bring the contest back (though they may shift their target to avoid attracting “wolf nuts”).

Woodchucks

Because woodchucks have adapted so well to living alongside humans and the woodland edge habitats we create through suburbanization, they are often considered a nuisance. They burrow under decks and outbuildings and gorge themselves on flowers, fruits, and vegetables in gardens across the eastern and midwestern United States. But woodchucks serve an important role as soil engineers and seed dispersers; besides, wantonly eradicating a large number of woodchucks eventually leads to more population booms. Woodchuck killing contests are also cruel: Springtime hunts leave babies orphaned, and wounded woodchucks are often left to suffer. Hunting WNY boasts that its annual woodchuck “derby” (sponsored by D&H Transport and Savage Arms) is “one of New York’s largest,” with over 100 participants every year. Currently, there are no protections for woodchucks under the New York Department of Environmental Conservation.

Marmots

In Idaho, yellow-bellied marmots (known locally as “rock chucks”) are popular killing contest targets. The 2018 Idaho Rock Chuck Derby was hosted in Castleford, Idaho, last May with a bevy of local sponsors, as well as a beer garden, food, and live music. The Hannah Bates Memorial Rock Chuck Derby in Bliss, Idaho, held in honor of a local 20-year-old woman who died of cancer in 2008, raises as much as $300,000 every year to support school athletic programs, local nonprofits, and children’s cancer support groups. The Facebook group “Rockchuck derby [sic]” keeps track of events held throughout the state for those who want to participate.

Prairie Dogs

Even though some prairie dogs are considered species of special concern, prairie dog hunting is legal and unfettered (without limits on the season for these nongame animals, hunting pregnant or nursing prairie dogs is fair game) in most of the states where prairie dogs live. Prairie dog burrows and holes are a nuisance to ranchers and farmers, so gun shops throughout the Midwest, Mountain West, and Southwest hold prairie dog killing contests as promotions. In 2013, a gun shop in New Mexico publicly advertised a prairie dog killing contest: The hunter that brought in the “most tails”—high-powered rifles usually blast the little rodents to smithereens, leaving only the tails—had their choice of a shotgun or a pair of semi-automatic rifles.

Squirrels

Squirrels, unlike many of the other animals catalogued here, are considered a small game animal in many states, so “squirrel slams” usually take place at the end of squirrel hunting season. While there are limits on the number of squirrels that can be killed in one day, pregnant squirrels are considered especially attractive targets to win the weigh-off. Protesters have been drawn to the annual Hazzard County Squirrel Slam in upstate New York, which serves as a fundraiser for the county’s fire department, but a lawsuit challenging the legality of the event was dismissed in 2017. Still, the New York State Assembly is considering a law that would ban “any contest, competition, tournament, or derby where the objective of such contest or competition is to take wildlife.”

Crows

Gun clubs across the northeastern United States are known to hold “crow downs” in the early spring. Besides the fact that crows play an important role as scavengers in these ecosystems, the birds have spectacular memories and can pass down trauma to later generations. Crow shoots are legal if they are within the bird’s hunting season, but they are increasingly going underground as the public responds to the wanton murder of murders. This March, a local hunting club in central Vermont canceled a crow shoot after a social media firestorm against the business that organized the event. In response, crow hunting enthusiasts on the website Crow Busters reminded each other on message boards to keep a low profile for crow killing contests; one commenter wrote, “You just have to be smarter than the anti's [sic] today, don't advertise what you are doing.”

Pigeons

Their epithet as “rats with wings” have made pigeons a killing contest target in some places. Pennsylvania likely hosts the most pigeon killing contests. In 2016, the state had at least 25 pigeon shoots; whereas across the rest of the country, there were only about five. Proponents of such events claim that killing contests are an effective way to manage pigeon populations, but pigeons are sometimes brought in for the events to ensure that there are enough birds to satisfy the bloodlust. “They capture pigeons in New York City and ship them to other states,” says Kobliska from SHARK, who has been tracking and recording pigeon shoots for years. “It’s hard to claim that there are too many, and then on the other hand you have to ship them in. But people don’t really question it.” The questioning is beginning, though, especially for contests held publically. Senator Jim Inhofe, the Oklahoma Republican, used to hold an annual pigeon slaughter fundraiser, but he put an end to the practice last year. Last spring, the Alabama Forestry Association held a state-sanctioned pigeon slaughter; after a public outcry resulting from SHARK’s disturbing footage of the affair, it was cancelled.

Rattlesnakes

Rattlesnake roundups are less contests than pageants of extreme cruelty, as “hunters” are paid by weight and are awarded cash prizes for bringing in the most and biggest snakes. Many people—ranchers especially, who worry that snakebites threaten their livestock and families—believe that the only good snake is a dead snake. But such fears are misguided: The last USDA report on cattle deaths attribute none to rattlesnake bites, and the CDC estimates that only five people are killed by venomous snakes in the United States every year. In 2016, the festival took in a record haul of 24,262 pounds of rattlesnakes; in 2017, organizers capped that number at 6,500 pounds.

Sharks

As if sharks didn’t have enough to worry about with commercial fishing, shark killing tournaments are grisly spectacles that reward participants with trophies and cash prizes for hooking, bleeding, gaffing, and suffocating sharks. Jaws-inspired fear fuels these contests, but some events try to justify the slaughter by saying that only large sharks are targeted and this helps shark populations grow. SHARK’s 2017 undercover investigation of a New Jersey shark tournament showed that small sharks are killed anyway. Sharks of all sizes are essential species in ocean ecosystems. As apex predators, they help keep the food web in balance, and since sharks are slow to reproduce, eliminating mature sharks can throw ocean ecosystems out of whack.

Cownose rays

When cownose rays migrate to the Chesapeake Bay to give birth, they are met with a nasty surprise. Pregnant rays are shot (often with bowfishing equipment, as the contests are funded by bowfishing manufacturers trying to popularize the sport) and ripped from the water, where they are sometimes beaten to death with baseball bats. As the rays die and their fetuses are expelled, the unborn rays are shoved back inside the dead mothers in order to increase the total weight of their kills. The contest’s proponents claim the rays eat the oysters essential to the Chesapeake Bay economy, but according to Mike Kobliska at SHARK, the science says the exact opposite. “They help the ecosystem in many ways,” he explains. “These are such gentle animals; they are not hurting anyone.” SHARK released an investigation of a 2015 contest that successfully persuaded the Maryland legislature to enact a two-year ban on cownose ray killing contests. The legislation is set to expire in July 2019.

Correction: This article has been amended to reflect the fact that there are currently no rattlesnake roundups in New Mexico. In addition, events taking place in Pennsylvania are not wildlife-killing contests; snakes collected for those events are returned to where they were captured after the festival ends.

Grasslands: General Information Grassland vegetation in Arizona, which include the mountain grassland type, the plains grasslands, and the desert grassland, covered approximately one-fourth of the state, 18,210,000 ac, in the early 1950s (Nichol 1952). Changes in management practices in the grassland vegetation zone over the years (alterations by grazing, both domestic and wildlife; exclusion of fire; and others) have resulted in an invasion of shrub and other woody plant species from adjacent vegetation zones on many sites. Thus, shrubs and other woody plant species form an intermixed overstory on many areas classified as grasslands at one time (Ffolliott and Thorud 1975b). Occurring throughout a range of elevations, individual grassland types that comprise this zone exhibit differences in terms of water yield and other natural resource potentials. Mountain Grasslands Mountain grasslands, small in aggregate area, are scattered throughout the mixed conifer and ponderosa pine forest types (Judd 1962, Lowe 1964). While tree species are not usually part of these communities, isolated trees or shrubs occur through invasion from the adjacent forests on cinder cones and elevated places within the grasslands. The forest edge, where the two habitats come together, is a well delineated ecotone. An ecotone is the transition area between two adjacent ecological communities. Greatest development of the mountain grassland type in Arizona is reached in the White Mountains and on the Kaibab Plateau. It is also represented on some of the higher, isolated mountains ranges in southern Arizona (Ffolliott and Thorud 1975b). Plant speciesCharacteristic grasses are timothy (Phleum pratense), Arizona fescue (Festuca arizonica), mountain muhly (Muhlenbergia montana), pine dropseed (Blepharoneuron triholepis), black dropseed (Sporobolus interreptus), mountain brome (Bromus marginatus), and the introduced Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis). Many of these species have high forage value for livestock and wildlife species. Recreation is a valuable resource of these high elevation grasslands because they are intermixed with the relatively cool and esthetic mixed conifer and ponderosa pine forest types. PrecipitationAnnual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches, with almost 50% occurring during the summer season. The general weather patterns of mountain grassland areas coincide with those in the adjacent forests types. SoilsSoils are usually fine-textured alluviums that are frequently and easily compacted and often have poor drainage. Mountain grasslands occupy relatively level terrain compared to most of the adjacent forests. Plains Grasslands The plains grassland type occurs as continuous or nearly uninterrupted cover between 5,000 and 7,000 ft, essentially in the eastern half of Arizona (Lowe 1964) (Figure 10-1 from Ffolliott and Thorud 1975). Plains grassland occasionally extends upward into the lower portion of the ponderosa pine vegetation type, and is often found intermixed with pinyon-juniper woodlands and sagebrush. PrecipitationThe average annual precipitation in the plains grasslands is about 17 inches, with extremes of approximately 10 and 20 inches (Lowe 1964). About 70% of the total annual precipitation falls between April and September (Judd 1962). SoilsSoils of the plains grassland type are generally very shallow-to-shallow, and predominately medium-textured. Deep, medium-to-fine textured alluvial soils are found along many of the drainages on these ranges.

Desert Grasslands The desert grassland type reaches its best development in southeastern Arizona, at elevations between 3,000 and 5,000 ft, although it also occurs in the northwestern quarter of the state (Judd 1962, Lowe 1964) (Figure 10-1 from Ffolliott and Thorud 1975). Desert grassland is a transitional grass-dominated landscape community, often positioned between desert shrubland below and the chaparral vegetation type above. The climate of the desert grasslands is generally characterized by warm to hot summers, and by mild and open winters (Martin 1973). This grassland type is the most arid of all North American grassland regions. Plant speciesThe grasses and forbs that characterize desert grassland ranges tend to grow and set seed rapidly because the rainy seasons are relatively short and somewhat uncertain. Most of the growth takes place during July, August, and sometimes part of September. However, since temperature is usually not a limiting factor at this time of year, the growth period is determined primarily by the amount, distribution, and timing of precipitation (Humphrey 1958). By October, most of the grasses and forbs are dry, and commonly remain so until the next rainy season. Most of the plant growth occurs in the summer rainy period because of the less favorable temperatures during the winter growing season, the frequent desiccated condition of the soil in the spring, and because many forage species are warm season grasses. PrecipitationPrecipitation in the desert grasslands varies from 10 to 12 inches annually, averaging about 6 inches (Judd 1962, Lowe 1964). Most of the precipitation occurs as liquid rainfall during two seasons, summer and winter (Humphrey 1958). Summer rains are largely in the form of thunderstorms, with high-intensity events lasting for short periods. Winter storms are frontal, producing relatively low-intensity precipitation events, with rainfall occurring intermittently for several days. Normally, relative humidities are low throughout the year, except during the storm periods. Temperatures and wind velocities are often high in the desert grasslands, and evaporation rates are high. For example, a 14-year pan evaporation record for the Santa Rita Experimental Range in south-central Arizona indicated an average annual evaporation rate of 109 inches (Humphrey 1958). The high temperature and wind velocities, coupled with the low humidity, account for the comparatively high evaporation rate. SoilsMany of the soils of the desert grasslands have been developed under high temperatures and low rainfall, and are generally known for their reddish color (Buol 1965). These soils are classified into three great soil groups: The Red Desert, the Reddish Brown, and the Reddish Chestnut. The Red Desert soils, which received from 11 to 20 inches of precipitation annually, develop at elevations between 2,500 and 5,000 ft. The value of these soils for range depends almost entirely upon the amount of precipitation they receive. The Red Desert soils provide only seasonal grazing for domestic livestock, while the Reddish Brown and Reddish Chestnut soils normally provide somewhat more forage.

Press Release

Endangered Fish Returns to Santa Cruz River Near Tucson

Recycled Wastewater Critical for Ecosystem Health

Contact(s):



















After an absence of more than 70 years, the endangered Gila topminnow has reappeared in the Santa Cruz River in northwest Tucson, fish surveys conducted in November confirm.

Scientists were hopeful native fish would return to the river near Tucson after the river’s water quality significantly improved following upgrades to wastewater treatment facilities releasing effluent (highly treated wastewater) into the river at Agua Nueva and Tres Rios treatment plants in 2013. The native Arizona species, listed under the Endangered Species Act, was rediscovered in the Santa Cruz River near Nogales, Arizona in 2015. Both sections of the river where the fish reappeared depend on releases of effluent, demonstrating the critical role this water plays for the river’s health.

“Finding Gila topminnow in the net was unexpected,” said Ross Timmons, native fish biologist with the Arizona Game and Fish Department. “After this previous summer’s runoff, we were expecting to find a different native fish, the longfin dace, but instead we found Gila topminnow.”

Scientists and residents have eagerly awaited the fish's return as the river’s water quality continually improves in this reliably flowing stretch. Fish species diversity has increased in both the Nogales and downstream Tucson sections of the river since 2009 and 2014 respectively; though, in Pima County, only non-native species were found until this year. Annual surveys aim to find all the species living in the river, but do not estimate population numbers.

“As our natural surface waters continue to decline, I think this clearly demonstrates the role treated effluent can play towards supporting the fish and wildlife populations that are dependent on our desert streams and rivers,” Timmons said.

For decades, both sections were so polluted that few fish of any kind were found during annual surveys. Significant upgrades to the regional facilities releasing water into the river were completed in 2009 near Nogales and in 2013 near Tucson.

According to Sonoran Institute’s annual Living River report, which has been tracking water quality and conditions along the Santa Cruz since before the upgrade of all facilities, fish now are able to thrive in healthier living conditions that include reduced toxin levels and increased levels of dissolved oxygen.

However, not all the water quality concerns have been addressed with the upgraded facilities. The International Outfall Interceptor, the pipeline bringing raw sewage to the Nogales International Wastewater Treatment Plant, is aging. Pipeline failures – the most recent of which occurred in July 2017 – dump raw sewage directly into the river, putting at risk decades of progress made in restoring the river’s health and the region’s economy and drinking water.

“Finding Gila Topminnow in the Santa Cruz River in Tucson is the most significant conservation discovery since the species was listed as endangered in 1967,” said Doug Duncan, fish biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. “We are not certain how the fish made it to the Tucson reach of the river, but we will analyze the genetics of the fish and river flow data to see if we can make that determination.”

Many rivers and streams in the southwestern United States depend on effluent for continued flows. As water becomes ever scarcer in the desert southwest, the value of returning wastewater to these ecosystems will only increase. Currently, about 25 miles of the Santa Cruz River flow year-round with the release of effluent. The Gila topminnow (Poeciliopsis occidentalis) once lived in the U.S. throughout the Gila River basin, from near the Colorado River into New Mexico. During the last half-century, its range has declined substantially. Natural populations only occur in multiple streams in the Santa Cruz River basin, including the section in Mexico, and a single location along the Gila River. However, Arizona Game and Fish Department and its partners have established an additional 66 wild and captive populations throughout the basin, and continue to establish more.

“Though many people focus on what we’ve lost, this year’s finding reinforces the fact that our Santa Cruz River is still living,” said Claire Zugmeyer, ecologist at the Tucson-based nonprofit Sonoran Institute, and long-time coordinator of the annual fish survey. “Yes, things have changed over the last century, but the Santa Cruz, whether it’s dry or wet, is still the backbone linking all our communities together. The return of the Gila topminnow demonstrates that the release of effluent into the Santa Cruz and other rivers can simultaneously recharge our aquifers, support important wildlife habitat, sustain our flowing river heritage and build valuable community amenities – such as the Loop.”

This year’s surveys were conducted by Sonoran Institute, U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Arizona Game and Fish Department, Pima County, University of Arizona, USGS Arizona Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Unit, Friends of the Santa Cruz River, National Park Service Tumacácori National Historical Park, and other partners. The partners have been conducting the annual survey since 2008 near Nogales and 2013 near Tucson to track the overall health of the Santa Cruz River.

The Sonoran Institute’s mission is to connect people and communities with the natural resources that nourish and sustain them. We work at the nexus of commerce, community, and conservation to help people in the North American West build the communities they want to live in while preserving the values which brought them here. We envision a West where civil dialogue and collaboration are hallmarks of decision making, where people and wildlife live in harmony, and where clean water, air, and energy are assured.

The mission of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is working with others to conserve, protect, and enhance fish, wildlife, plants, and their habitats for the continuing benefit of the American people. We are both a leader and trusted partner in fish and wildlife conservation, known for our scientific excellence, stewardship of lands and natural resources, dedicated professionals, and commitment to public service.

The Arizona Game and Fish Department’s mission is to conserve and protect Arizona’s diverse wildlife resources and manage for safe, compatible outdoor recreation opportunities for current and future generations. The department has trust responsibility for managing more than 800 native wildlife species, the most of any inland state.

Established in 1978, the Pima County Regional Flood Control District strives to use forward-looking floodplain management practices to minimize flood and erosion damages for all county residents, property and public infrastructure. Regionally, the District is involved in the management of water and natural resources as part of the Sonoran Desert Conservation Plan.

The goal of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at The University of Arizona is to inspire and educate students and to produce world class research about nature and principles underlying ecological and evolutionary processes, the origin and maintenance of biodiversity, and the diversity and dynamics of the world’s natural systems.

The USGS Cooperative Research Unit Program was established in 1935 to enhance graduate education in fisheries and wildlife sciences and to facilitate research between natural resource agencies and universities on topics of mutual concern.

The National Park Service’s mission is to preserve unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations.

Friends of the Santa Cruz River (FOSCR) is a volunteer conservation group dedicated to protecting the upper Santa Cruz River. Our goals are to ensure a continued flow of the river’s surface waters, promote the highest water quality achievable, and to celebrate and restore the riparian ecosystem and diversity of life supported by the river’s waters.
